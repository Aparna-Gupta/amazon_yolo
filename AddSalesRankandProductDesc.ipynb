Inner bottom is NOT FLAT as in the picture - it is spherical.No two cups are alike - the inner bottom of one of my cups is much closer to the outer bottom than on the other. Height is the same, but diameters are not. The narrower mug has more inner depth, so the actual capacity is, indeed, the same! Their size makes one think about using them for beer, but make sure that your buddies are light-hearted, or one of them will leave thinking that he was served a \"smaller\" cup, though he was not - again, inner capacity is exactly the same, though it does not look like it from the outside.Love them, have much more faith in their longevity than the \"nicer\" looking European brands'}\n",

We let it cool and then use a nylon pad with good hot soapy water and it cleans up like nothing you can imagine.  I would definitely buy one again.', 'description': \"Distinguished among All-Clad's renowned cookware collections by  its stylish, charcoal-black, hard-anodized aluminum exterior, the LTD  line provides serious and professional cooks with all the virtues that  make All-Clad's worldwide reputation unsurpassed. Key to its high  performance is a three-ply, bonded construction. Sandwiched between the  exterior and the interior lies a thick core of pure aluminum that  spreads heat evenly across the bottoms of pots and pans and all the way  up the sides. The striking exterior resists scratching, chipping, and  peeling. Certain pieces, like this one, have two interior layers, one  of 18/10 stainless steel and the other of scratch-resistant,  professional-grade nonstick bonded to the steel.This grill pan exemplifies why All-Clad's LTD cookware appeals to  contemporary cooks. It's 11 inches square, perfect for grilling four  big burgers or two porterhouse steaks. Plus, the meat will look better  than if it had come from a flat pan because the grill marks it  appetizingly. Because the grill's cooking surface is made of durable  nonstick, you can grill halibut steaks without fat for a healthy meal,  and the grill cleans up easily. Its polished, 18/10 stainless-steel  handle is secured to the pan by stainless-steel rivets for strength,  grooved on the top and rounded on the bottom for comfort, and holed in  the end for hanging on a hook or peg. The long handle stays cool on the  stovetop but won't be harmed by an oven's heat. LTD cookware carries a  lifetime warranty against defects and should be hand washed.--Fred  Brack\"}\n",

These pots and pans offer a stylish, attractive look while making cooking and cleanup for family meals or special occasions easy and low-stress. Contemporary Nonstick cookware replaces Calphalon&#x92;s original and highly popular Professional Nonstick II line--but with improvements to make it even better. The most obvious enhancement is in the versatile rounded and flared design of the pots and pans. This design makes a single pan suitable for various cooking techniques and provides better access for pouring and stirring. Also convenient is the capacity line on these pots and pans, which helps prevent cooks from overfilling them.This 5-quart saucier cooks a hefty amount of food and is an excellent example of the Contemporary Nonstick line&#x92;s versatility. With its high sides, flared rim, and two handles, this pan is equally ideal for simmering a beef and tomato ragu on the stovetop or baking a macaroni-and-cheese casserole in the oven. The pan&#x92;s exterior is made of hard-anodized aluminum for superior heat distribution. The interior is coated with a nonstick surface that is resistant to peeling, chipping, flaking, or cracking. This pan has ergonomic brushed stainless-steel handles that stay cool to the touch on the stovetop and are riveted to the pans for durability. The lid is tempered glass--for viewing food as it cooks&#x97;encircled by a stainless-steel band that complements the cookware and fits snugly into the rim. All Contemporary Nonstick cookware is oven-safe up to 450 degrees F and is covered by a lifetime warranty.--Cristina Vaamonde'}\n",

      "{'title': \"The Wok Shop's Own 14&quot; Flat Bottom Carbon Steel Handhammered Pow Wok w/ Metal Hollow Handle (Round Bottom in Photo)\", 'salesRank': {'Kitchen & Dining': 57321}, 'Best review': \"Without exaggeration, I looked at every single WOK on amazon and read every single review before I bought this wok.  It is just as the other positive reviewers state.  This is one of those cheap products that just do a fantastic job and worth every one of its few pennies.  The first thing I made was scrambled eggs and they were so moist and fluffy that we don't call them scrambled eggs anymore, around my house we call them WOK eggs.I could go on an on about the accolades of this fine cooking utensil, but you can already find all of those reviews elsewhere.  I will provide this VERY effective and critically important seasoning procedure that exceeded my expectations with this wok:1)  Use a scouring pad and dish degergent to scrub off the protective machine oil coating that this wok ships with.  (Yes it's yucky, yes others have complained about it, but I appreciate my wok being shipped with a protective film)2)  Did you get all the oil off?  Clean it again! :)3)  Fold a paper towel in a nice tight square, and dip it into some Canola oil (cooking oil).4)  Lightly and evenly coat the entire wok, inside and outside.  Yes, both sides.  And I will again stress LIGHTLY and EVENLY, which means there is no dripping or running oil.5)  Pop it in the oven for 20 minutes at 450F6)  Crack all the windows and doors in the house and turn on the ventilation hood if you have one.  Since you coated your WOK lightly and evenly (right?) the burning oil smoke isn't horrible and will clear out in 30 minutes.  No big deal.Your wok will come out beautifully and evenly bronzed.  I was aghast when I pulled mine out, and so excited.  The thick, shiny patina works wonderfully while cooking.  I chose to go ahead and season mine twice, repeating steps 2-6.  It gave an even darker and thicker patina.  If you scrape or puncture your seasoned coating while cooking, fret not.  Just keep on cooking, grease or oil will likely burn into that area as you cook.  You can re-season your wok as much as you like, of course.On one last note, I chose not to season the handle of my Wok, since that would make it a bit slippery and this wok requires a good strong grip as it weighs a few pounds.Happy wok-in!\", 'description': \"This wok is round bottom with a single, metal handle.

I have had no problems with splinters, gouging or dulling of my knives.  It has been such a great product that I am surprised to see some of the review here.  Possibly they had some problems with the first releases that have been fixed now.Bamboo is a harder wood than most cutting boards are made from, 16% harder than maple with is the standard for cutting boards, and that takes a little bit of getting used too.  The knife cut ends at the cutting board rather than cutting in like it would with a softer wood or plastic board.A benefit of the added hardness is a less-porous surface, which means the cutting board doesn\\'t absorb as much water and nasty little bacteria.  There is some debate as too whether bamboo is too hard, and will blunt knives, but that has not been my experience.The board is light, and a good size so that it can be moved around my kitchen pretty easily.  I don\\'t have a lot of space, so I appreciate the ease of storage.  Because bamboo is made from pressed woods held together by glue, there has been some concerns over their safety but Totally Bamboo uses a proprietary food-approved glue.Probably the main reason to use a bamboo cutting board over another hard wood is that it is ecologically sound. Bamboo, being a grass and not a true hard wood, is a quickly-replenishing resource that can grow up to two feet a day.  On top of that, they look beautiful.  The \"Totally Bamboo Kauai Cutting Board\" looks good enough to use as a serving board', 'description': \"From the original bamboo cutting board company, Totally Bamboo, this cutting board is a beautiful, functional, ecologically sound addition to any kitchen.  Bamboo is 16% harder than maple, making it an excellent cutting surface.  Bamboo is actually a grass that grows to a harvestable height of 60 feet in about 3 to 5 years, growing as much as 2 feet per day.  It has an extensive root system that continually sends up new shoots, naturally replenishing itself.  It does not require replanting, making it one of the most renewable resources known.  Totally Bamboo uses 'Moso' timber bamboo which is neither a food source nor a habitat for the Giant Panda.  Totally Bamboo's cutting boards are assembled with approved food-grade glue -- none of their products are made with formaldehyde-based glue. No dyes or stains are used in the manufacturing process.  The pleasing designs are created by combining originally-colored bamboo with steamed bamboo, which darkens due to caramellized sugars within the wood.  Totally Bamboo prides itself on using only premium hand-selected bamboo, innovative design, exemplary craftmanship, and fair labor policies.\"}\n",

I was looking for the smallest piece that could hold the Teac and some records, plus a place to put vinyl record cleaners, etc.Quality:  The finish is even and the materials are sturdy enough for all that I want.  This is not a flimsy item.Assembly:  I was concerned with a review on one of the other Crosley cabinets that it was very difficult to assemble and definitely required two people.  I don't know how they were assembling it, but if one follows the directions one person can easily put it together in under 1/2 hour.  It DID take me a while to figure out that the nut locks were already IN the pieces as I was looking for them in a bag.Finished look:  This is sitting next to my old fashioned stereo cabinet that I can't bear to replace and also my baby grand piano.  Both of those items are beautifully finished and this piece fits in just fine (although somewhat hidden behind a floor stereo speaker.)Cons:  As described, the item comes with a shelf above the record storage.  The knob makes it appear like a pull out drawer, but it is a pull down door with a shelf behind.  I was expecting a drawer, but that was my fault for not reading the description well enough.  Unlike the other pieces that have just the open shelf, at least this one has a door and it will be fine for storing the LP vinyl record cleaning supplies and extra phonograph needles that I purchased.Bottom Line:  Love it.\"}\n",

I looked at other magnetic holders, but I was concerned about the chance of damage to the blade edges from striking the metal surface of most holders.  When I saw this holder, I knew I had my answer.  The bamboo not only looks attractive, it does a good job of preventing accidental damage to the blades.  I had some concern that the covering would space the blade too far from the magnet to get good holding power, but that has not been a problem.  I wish the price was a bit lower, but I still think this is a superior solution.UPDATE:It is six months later, and I just ordered a second one of these for my kitchen.  I have been very pleased with the one I have, but the recent addition of a cleaver and a second chef\\'s knife has exceeded the capacity of my existing bar, so a second one was needed.I\\'d like to respond briefly to those who are bothered by the magnetic cogging which causes knives to have a preferred location on the bar.

If I need to vent/have steam release, I just slightly tilt the lid. When placed on top of the pots and pans, the lids fit snugly and work the way lids should.~~~~CLEAN-UP: Clean-up is crazy-easy and everything washes off as simply and easily as the day I bought them, it could not be easier. I don\\'t put these in my dishwasher, I wash them by hand (with mild, non-citric dishwashing liquid) to keep them in great condition.~~*OF NOTE: The paperwork that came with this set suggested to never use temperatures higher than the \"medium\" setting. I was concerned at first, as I thought this might take everything much longer to cook. But, due to the special way the bases are made, they require less heat due to special heat distribution properties. I can bring water to a boil easily on the medium setting in as short a time with these as I could with my old, thinner pots on high.*I was worried that this set\\'s exterior finish would get scorched and ruined by my stove\\'s gas flames, so shortly after getting this set I also purchased this:Nordic Ware 8 Inch Heat Tamer and Burner Platewhich does a wonderful job of preserving the exterior\\'s finish.(I thought I\\'d add this in case this ever happens to you): About the 3rd time I used the steamer insert/pot for steaming some broccoli and cauliflower, I became distracted and the water ended up boiling completely away and I was left with a burnt mess inside the water pot. I was so upset, as I didn\\'t think I\\'d be able to save it. However, after letting it cool, washing off what I could, I added a couple of drops of dishwashing liquid and some water to the pot, and simmered it for about 20 minutes. After it had cooled enough for me to work with, was able get every bit of the burned mess (residue from bits of broccoli and cauliflower that had dropped through the steamer insert) off to get it back to brand-new looking and performing condition.

Watch the prices, don't overpay, and you will be very happy with your purchase!\", 'description': \"Created by tableware designer and gourmet cook Debbie Segura in 2001, Sorrento is perhaps Signature Houseware's most popular dinnerware pattern. Sorrento stoneware suits almost any kitchen d&#xE9;cor with its rustic, Italian countryside feel, showing a raised dot and olive leaf patterning on most of the solid-colored, thickly-glazed pieces. Square plates are also available, and bakeware and glassware complete the extensive collection, now available in more than half a dozen colors ranging from neutral suede to bright ruby red.The smallest of three nesting Sorrento mixing bowls, this one measures eight inches in diameter and holds up to 60 ounces, or roughly two quarts, ideal for whisking eggs for an omelet or serving a fresh fruit salad. All three mixing bowls feature a different exterior pattern. The rim band on this small bowl, which helps provides grip, is embossed with Sorrento's signature three-leaf design, while bands of lines and dots run up and down the sides. Alone or with the two larger mixing bowls, this attractive and functional bowl makes a great gift for someone who is building a Sorrento collection. Completely lead-free, the durable, chip-resistant stoneware is safe for use in the microwave, dishwasher, and conventional oven for warming.--Ann Bieri\"}\n",

They were not microwave-safe, were really quite small, had no lip for picking them up (really a pain in the neck, especially if what I was serving was very hot in temperature) & scratched rather easily. I did my research & decided these would fit the bill better than just getting a newer set of Pyrex cups- those were smaller, people had issues with them exploding (Pyrex is not as reliable a brand as it used to be apparently) & only came four to a pack. I wanted enough that I could entertain six people with a set. I did not want to buy metal condiment holders because they can alter the flavor of foods AND cannot be microwaved. I wanted something that could be safely put in the top rack of the dishwasher (and these come out just great washed that way, no soaking needed). A set of six, as opposed to just four, was a nice bonus & I think the price point is great for what I got. These were nicely boxed, and would've made a perfect gift, as they were packaged just as you'd expect something from a department store to be. Each one was safely packed separately, and there were no chips, scratches or marring in the glass at all. THANK YOU to the manufacturer, as well, for not sticking a stupid label on any of these bowls for me to remove. So many companies do this to their glassware & it's an absolute drag.I love these for serving horseradish sauce with roast beef or steak, melted butter w/ lobster tails, cocktail sauce with shrimp, ketchup with French fries, jalepenos & other toppings for nachos that people want on the side, hot cherry peppers with subs, au jus for dipping-style sandwiches, granola on the side for yogurt, a single serving of sunflower or pumpkin seeds (1/4 c.) & much more. Nuts & seeds are so easy to lose control with, portion-wise, and these help control that for snacking while still looking really cute for serving. I also utilize them for holding spices before baking, because I can carefully put each spice into these a tsp. or TBSP. at a time without worrying about accidentally dumping too much of a spice into a mixing bowl directly from the little spice jar. Because these are microwave-safe, you can also use them for heating up an individual serving of caramel, butterscotch or hot fudge sauce.\", 'description': 'The Quattro Stagioni serve and entertain collection is designed with charming old world Italian embossed d&#xFFFD;cor  - Quattro Stagioni -which means \" four seasons\" is reflective through-out the collection.'}\n",

And finally you can use it. This is only done the first time around.When we cooked on the grill there was no smoke which I have noticed on another electric grill that a friend uses- the smoke might be due to old grease.. don't know.

Then move the blade to the stage 2 guide and draw back and forth 10 times through finer diamond crystals for the second, fine-edged bevel. Serrated blades go only through stage 2.

      "{'title': 'Dylos DC1100 Laser Air Quality Monitor', 'salesRank': {'Home &amp; Kitchen': 79804}, 'Best review': \"I have several air cleaners in my house, and I recommend them highly. But, I was a bit lost as to exactly to what degree they were improving the air quality in my house...I had no way of really knowing. I also found the filter replacement times somewhat vague. You replace them based on keeping track of how many hours you have run your air cleaner at a given fan speed--the higher the fan speed, the fewer total hours of run time until you need to change each filter. This does not seem like the best way of knowing when to replace these costly items.Doesn't it make sense that if there is not so much dust in your house, but a lot of dust in someone else's house, that running an identical air cleaner for the same amount of time and fan speed as the people in the other house is going to mean that your filters are not going to be plugged up as quickly as theirs? And, in order to save energy on the electric bill, how do I know what is the lowest fan speed to use to actually keep my air clean, given the size of my room and the actual dust that it contains or that flows into the room from doors and windows?I started doing some research online and eventually came across this device.I bought one of these Dylos air quality monitors and now that I am using it, I couldn't imagine running good air cleaners without one. It gives you an immediate readout of the quantity of particles floating around in your air, and a scale to tell you what that means. It allows you to see what is going on in your room, with your air cleaner, with your dust problem at this moment as it is affected by the outside air currents, etc.. This will make it possible to determine the best fan speed, and also allows you to tell the condition of your filters by measuring the clean air output of your air cleaner. You replace your filters when they are not filtering properly anymore, not when some arbitrary timer tells you to. I can move the Dylos from room to room to check, as it is small and light.For the small cost of this device relative to electric costs and filter costs, it is a steal in the long run. I have no affiliation with Dylos. They have been well reviewed elsewhere and make the most reasonable particle counter on the market.

They are shorter than I expected; however, I didn\\'t bother to read the product description that accurately provides the tote\\'s dimensions.  (Not grossly shorter - just 2-3 inches.)  That said, it turns out that I actually like the shorter height much more than other taller totes I\\'ve used.  I\\'m just under 5\\'3\" tall and I can grab two of these totes by their handles, each loaded with groceries, one tote in each hand, arms down straight, and carry both without having to awkwardly lift them up to keep them from dragging on the ground.  I LOVE THIS!  I can\\'t do this with taller totes.Aside from the distinct advantage these totes have for shorter people, the bag itself is very nice.  The material is similar to other store-brand bags, but it\\'s a little stronger/more rigid, and the two corner bottle holders are incredibly useful.  I use the bottle holders for other things too.  I came home today with three clamshell containers of grape tomatoes - they fit perfectly stacked one on top of the other in a bottle holder.  The truth is, a 2-liter bottle of soda and a bottle of wine could easily fit into one bottle holder.I hook the small looped tab on one side to the back of the plastic bag dispenser at the checkout stand which helps keep the bag open for easy filling.  There\\'s a rigid insert/base that fits in the bottom to keep everything stable.  This base has to be moved to the bottom before filling, then raised to one side to fold the bag flat again after use - all very easy.  Because the fabric is more substantial and rigid than a canvas bag, the tote remains upright in the trunk or cargo area, and the contents stay put instead of rolling out and all over the place.  Gotta love it. . .'}\n",

I can't open cans, twist lids off, or open bottles of wine.This is where my Ozeri Pro Electric Wine Bottle Opener with Wine Pourer, Stopper, Foil Cutter and Elegant Recharging Stand, in Rubberized Black, comes to the rescue.When I first received the product I had to plug the unit into the electricity supply, and charge it for 8 hours.  This was very simple to do.  Once it was fully charged it states that it will open up to 40 bottles.I drink the odd glass of wine at home, and couldn't wait to see if this gadget would make my life easier for me.  I looked at the leaflet that came with the Wine Bottle Opener, and it looked so simple.  First I took the foil cutter out of the back of the stand, that holds the bottle opener, and placed it around the top of the wine bottle.  I twisted it, and the foil came off easily.  No broken nails, or pain in my wrist.  I then slotted it back into housing unit, so I wouldn't loose it.I held the bottle in my left hand, keeping it upright, and then placed the Ozeri Electric Wine Bottle Opener on top of the wine bottle.  With it in place, I then pressed the bottom button, with the arrow pointing downwards.  It then went into the cork, and took it up into the opener.  Once it had stopped, I had my wine bottle open.  I put the bottle down, and then pressed the upper button, with the arrow pointing up, and the cork came out of the opener.That is so neat, and done in no time at all.  No chance of me cutting my fingers on the foil, ruining my nails, or hurting my wrist.  I didn't have a broken cork, or bits of cork in the wine either.  As I don't drink a whole bottle of wine in one sitting, I am also enjoying the silver, and black stopper, that I use instead of the cork.The bottle opener then goes back into the recharging unit, and stays there until the next bottle of wine, needs opening.So today was my birthday, and the wine came out.  Normally Len would open the wine for me, but with my new 'toy', I couldn't wait to do it myself.  I have opened 3 bottles of wine with it, and it has worked perfectly every time.It does state on the leaflet that: It may experience problems with a small percentage of plastic/synthetic and undersized corks. If so the cork should be removed manually.I am having fun with my elegant rubberized black Ozeri Electric Wine Opener.  It stands in my kitchen, and looks great.  The base and top are black, with silver buttons, and top.  This is a talking point when I am entertaining, and I can't wait to show it off to more friends.  They will most likely want me to bring it to their parties, or may buy one themselves.I was sent the Electric Wine Opener by Ozeri for my personal use. I was under no contract, or obligation to write a review, or to write a favorable one if I chose to write one.\", 'description': 'The Ozeri Pro Electric Wine Opener makes opening wine bottles easy while entertaining your guests at the same time.

      "{'title': 'Furi Rachael Ray Coppertail 3-Piece East/West Bamboo Knife Set', 'salesRank': {'Kitchen & Dining': 132274}, 'Best review': 'I love these knives.  They are exceptionally sharp and will even slice freshly baked bread without mashing it down.  Veggies are like butter.  I would urge you to put these in your knife collection.  But, then again, you may not use the old ones at all!!', 'description': 'The unique \"East/West\" blade design of F&#xFC;ri Pro Coppertail knives combines the sharpness and scalloping of a Santoku with the thinness and curved edge of a chef\\'s knife. The result is cutlery that is superb for straight slicing without sticking but that still works into a great rocking motion for speedy mincing or chopping. Not to mention that Coppertail knives are the cutlery of choice for cookbook author and Food Network host Rachael Ray, who has a great deal of clout with home chefs.This box set packs two Coppertail cook\\'s knife/vegetable chopper knives. The first has a 5-inch blade for handling smaller fare, such as halving cherry tomatoes or slicing mushrooms. The longer 7-inch blade is ideal for bigger jobs, such as chiffonading spinach or slicing large tomatoes. Knives are made of a single piece of high-carbon Japanese stainless-steel alloy so there are no gaps where food particles can get caught and no plastic pieces or rivets that can potentially fall off over time. The strength of this steel allows for an extremely sharp cutting edge that requires minimal maintenance to keep its sharpness.The ergonomically shaped handles on this cutlery feel lightweight yet properly balanced and provide a comfortable grip through hours of cooking. Handles are curved but have wedge-shaped angles on the top and bottom to reduce the amount of squeezing and hand strain and to prevent slipping when hands are wet or oily. Additionally, these knives have a notch just beyond the bolster that comfortably cradles the index finger and are the only brand with a counterbalancing copper insert at the ends to maintain the ideal weight between handle and blade. After years of sharpenings, the blade can lose a great deal of metal, which throws off the balance of the blade. The copper insert can be honed down to reduce handle weight and restore the proper balance.These two knives come in a gorgeous bamboo wood gift/storage box with sturdy metal hinges and a magnetic closure on the front. Engineered in Australia and manufactured in China, F&#xFC;ri Pro cutlery is covered by a limited lifetime warranty.--Cristina Vaamonde'}\n",

I was actually going to the store to buy All Clad, but there was such a good deal and so many extras on Calphalon, I decided to try them out.  Both my husband and I cooked in them.  My husband had stuff sticking all over, but he used too high of heat.  Mine did not stick.  Even with his food sticking, they cleaned so easily (I did have to use Bar Keepers Friend on the pan that he made potato in to get the rainbow coloring off of it, but it did not take any longer that washing it with dish soap).  My husband was not to sure about them after his experience.  I cooked bacon and sausage in them as well, no sticking.  I decided to put them to a real test, an egg.  I scrambled an egg (only way I like them lately), and let it set out for several minutes, and did the butter test that was in the directions.  After adjusting the temp. to get it right, I poured the egg into the pan (half expecting it to stick after reading some reviews).  Not one piece stuck!!  I have an electric glass cook top, so if it was going to stick, it would probably be on my stove.  So far, they seem like they will work out good.  They were definitely a great value for the quality.

A marker on the top of the water tank helps you keep track of when the water filter needs to be changed. Other handy extras on the AromaDeluxe include a filter release button, which swings the detachable filter basket open for filling or easy cleaning, and a pause-and-serve feature, which stops the brewing while you pour a cup of coffee midway through a cycle. For safety, the glass carafe has a comfortable, nonslip handle with an open design to accommodate larger hands. Further safety measures include a large, red power button that is easy to see but difficult to switch on by accident. This coffeemaker is covered by a one-year limited warranty.--Cristina Vaamonde\"}\n",
