However, along with air, liquids are also vacuumed out of the bag, leading to partial and even failed seals. Our VP112 Chamber Machine uses a different technology to eliminate this problem. When sealing with our chamber machine, the vacuum bag that will be sealed is placed inside the chamber of the machine and the lid is closed. Air is sucked out of the entire chamber, not just the bag itself, allowing air pressure on both the inside and outside of the bag to remain equal and liquids to stay in the bag.

Competition There are an abundance of stamped and etched graters available in the market, but not all graters are created equal. Only Cuisipro's graters take etched graters to the next level with a special Surface Glide Technology, exclusive to Cuisipro.  In addition to razor sharp etched blades the Surface Glide Technology creates the perfect balance between ease of grating and maximum efficiency for the ultimate grating experience that etched graters alone cannot compete with.  In addition to the exclusive Cuisipro Surface Glide Technology, the entire line of Cuisipro graters and shavers possess well-applied ergonomics. Features Grate More With Less Effort With Surface Glide Technology:  The science behind Super Glide Technology is based in the repeated grooved pattern that is spread evenly across the face of the grating surface. The grooves provide 2 distinct benefits beyond other graters. First, the groove reduces resistance, making grating effortless. Secondly the groove elongates the length of each individual blade, so it has a larger cutting surface that comes in contact with food, therefore producing more gratings per stroke. Combined these features to create a perfect surface for outstanding uninterrupted grating performance where food glides through blades.  Protective Cover Doubles As A Measuring Tool:  The Rasps and Flat grater collection feature a snap on, clear protective cover with US and metric measurements. Not only does the cover provide safe storage, but is a container to catch grated ingredients for measuring. Very few graters offer protective covers and no other grater in the market provides a cover with the added benefit of measuring or catching the grated ingredient. Secure Grip For Safety:  The entire line of graters feature ergonomic handles with non-slip finish designed to protect your hands while providing the best grip possible for safe grating. Similar rasps graters don't have handles and other graters don't have the same attention to non-slip grip and ergonomic handles.   Non Slip End for Stability:  The Rasps, Flat and Dual graters have non\ufffdslip ends and box grater a non-slip base that keep the graters in place and steady while resting on the cutting board. No chance of grater slipping or sliding around the surface. Majority of graters do not include non-slip ends \ufffd especially for rasps and dual graters. All Cuisipro products are backed by a 25 year warranty.   ", "salesrank_2018": "192345"}, "B003Z0BM40": {"description": "Supreme Fleece Blanket. 100-Percent soft fleece polyester.

From getting the family out the door in the morning to hosting a successful dinner party, the Oster countertop oven's got you covered. Large 6-Slice Capacity The oven provides an extra-large interior that can accommodate up to six slices of toast (or English muffins or bagels) at a time, a large frozen 12-inch pizza, a creamy casserole, or even a 13-by-9-inch pan of crescent rolls or chocolate-chip cookies. Upper and lower rack positions and a removable wire rack allow for customizing the space, which comes in handy when cooking a tall roast. Versatile Cooking and Up to 33% Faster with Convection Technology The countertop oven's manual control panel helps ensure easy operation. Choose from five functions: toast, bake, convection bake, broil, or warm. Simply press the button to make your selection. When set to warm, only the bottom element operates; when set to broil, only the top element operates. The convection-bake setting uses both the top and bottom elements, along with a built-in fan, to quickly heat up and evenly circulate the air, keeping the temperature steady. Convection baking delivers constant, thorough heat for evenly cooked food, and it typically requires a shorter cook time--up to 33% faster--than non-convection baking; it's perfect for pies, pastries, blueberry muffins, and other yummy baked goods. Adjustable Temperature Control and Timer Adjust the heat to the desired temperature, anywhere from 150 to 450 degrees F, with a turn of the dial. The second control dial sets the desired cooking time anywhere from 0 to 60 minutes. After the set time has elapsed, a bell signal sounds, and the oven turns off automatically. The timer can also be set to \"stay on\" for non-timed cooking or be used to make a light-to-dark shade selection when toasting bread. User-Friendly Design Other highlights include a \"power\" indicator light that illuminates when the timer is set to begin warming, an interior light that turns on when the timer is running, a glass door for safely viewing food as it cooks, and an external crumb tray that pulls out for easy cleanup.

Accessories include a collapsible measuring cup and an adjustable measuring spoon, and the manual includes over 80 recipes. The bread machine measures 14 by 19 by 12 inches and carries a two-year limited warranty. The Breadman BK2000B 2-1/2-Pound Bakery Pro Bread MakerGet the bread maker that makes it easy to bake like a pro and really bring home the bakery. This unique, 2-1/2-pound bread machine offers a wide range of features that you won\u2019t find anywhere else. You\u2019ll enjoy all your favorite baked goods at home, with exceptional results you\u2019d expect from a baking professional. Breadman Exclusive Features   Two one-pound loaves.          Fruit & nut dispenser.    Collapsible paddles remove easily.  We start with a dual bread pan baking system, which allows you to bake one standard loaf up to 2-1/2 pounds or use the side-by-side 1-pound loaf pans to make two one-pound loaves of bread simultaneously. This way, you can make a traditional whole wheat bread for dinner and bake a dessert bread for after the meal at the same time. Inside the bread pans, our exclusive patented collapsible kneading paddles collapse automatically before baking begins, to prevent the paddles from sticking in the bottom of the loaf as it bakes. This keeps the paddles out of your baked bread, to help prevent rips and tears caused in the bottom of the loaf by removing the paddles. It\u2019s perfect for better loaves and unbroken sandwich bread. Our final exclusive patented feature is our automatic fruit and nut dispenser. This handy feature allows you to add up to 2/3 cups of fruit and nuts into the dispenser to release automatically at the right time for perfect fruit and nut bread without waiting around. Instead of waiting around to add the fruits and nuts into a loaf at the add ingredient beep, the machine does it for you automatically. This way, your family can enjoy hot baked cinnamon raisin bread for breakfast without waking up before the sun rises to add the raisins. Extended Program Options In addition to these Breadman exclusive features, the Bakery Pro Bread machine offers a wide variety of your favorite programming options including low carb, gluten free, dough and jam. You also get rapid bake settings on white, whole wheat and sweet loaves, as well as a handy bake-only setting for specialty baking with ease. This model also features our up to 15-hour delay bake timer that lets you adjust the delay anywhere from one to fifteen hours. In addition, you have a 60-minute keep warm cycle that keeps finished loaves warm for up to one hour, plus a 7-minute power failure protection system that saves program settings for 7 minutes in case of a power outage so you can still get a great loaf even if there\u2019s a surge or brown out. Bonus Accessories The Bakery Pro comes with 3 bread pans; one bread pan allows you to bake up to a 2-1/2-pound loaf, while the two 1-pound bread pans allow you to bake two different loaves at the same time side-by-side. In addition, we give you a collapsible measuring cup and adjustable measuring spoon to help you get easy, exact measurements for the best loaves of bread. The Use & Care manual comes in an attractive, spiral-bound booklet along with over 80 unique recipes to excite your taste buds and inspire your baking creativity.

Competition There are an abundance of stamped and etched graters available in the market, but not all graters are created equal. Only Cuisipro's graters take etched graters to the next level with a special Surface Glide Technology, exclusive to Cuisipro.  In addition to razor sharp etched blades the Surface Glide Technology creates the perfect balance between ease of grating and maximum efficiency for the ultimate grating experience that etched graters alone cannot compete with.  In addition to the exclusive Cuisipro Surface Glide Technology, the entire line of Cuisipro graters and shavers possess well-applied ergonomics. Features Grate More With Less Effort With Surface Glide Technology:  The science behind Super Glide Technology is based in the repeated grooved pattern that is spread evenly across the face of the grating surface. The grooves provide 2 distinct benefits beyond other graters. First, the groove reduces resistance, making grating effortless. Secondly the groove elongates the length of each individual blade, so it has a larger cutting surface that comes in contact with food, therefore producing more gratings per stroke. Combined these features to create a perfect surface for outstanding uninterrupted grating performance where food glides through blades.  Protective Cover Doubles As A Measuring Tool:  The Rasps and Flat grater collection feature a snap on, clear protective cover with US and metric measurements. Not only does the cover provide safe storage, but is a container to catch grated ingredients for measuring. Very few graters offer protective covers and no other grater in the market provides a cover with the added benefit of measuring or catching the grated ingredient. Secure Grip For Safety:  The entire line of graters feature ergonomic handles with non-slip finish designed to protect your hands while providing the best grip possible for safe grating. Similar rasps graters don't have handles and other graters don't have the same attention to non-slip grip and ergonomic handles.   Non Slip End for Stability:  The Rasps, Flat and Dual graters have non\ufffdslip ends and box grater a non-slip base that keep the graters in place and steady while resting on the cutting board. No chance of grater slipping or sliding around the surface. Majority of graters do not include non-slip ends \ufffd especially for rasps and dual graters.

For your safety convenience and power conservation, it has an automatic shut off feature that will shut the pad off after 10 hours just in case you forget. It also comes standard with built in over-temperature protection for that extra bit of safety and peace of mind.

Using dry and pre-moistened cleaning cloths, Mint picks up the dust, dirt and pet hair that constantly accumulate on floors. Mint's compact design gets into tight spaces, under furniture and into other areas that are hard to reach with traditional mops and sweepers.  Guided by the NorthStar Navigation System cube, Mint tracks where it cleans so it doesn't miss a spot (see larger image). \u00a0 The easy-to-use controls (see larger image).  Guided by the NorthStar Navigation System, Mint methodically cleans open areas by moving back and forth in straight lines, working around furniture and rugs, and cleaning along baseboards.  Mint is easy to use. Simply attach your cleaning cloth of choice, choose sweep or mop and let Mint clean for you. Since Mint is not a vacuum, there are no bins to empty or filters to replace. So you can enjoy hassle-free clean floors every day.  Intelligent Navigation The NorthStar Navigation System works like an indoor GPS that helps Mint keep track of where it has been and where it needs to go. Specifically, the NorthStar Cube projects a signal that Mint uses to determine its location. Then as Mint starts cleaning, it builds a map of the area as it goes, marking walls, obstacles and drop offs as it encounters them. After Mint finishes cleaning open areas and around obstacles, it performs a final edge cleaning along walls and furniture and then returns to where it started so you know right where to find it.   The dry (above) and wet (below) microfiber cleaning cloths(see larger image). \u00a0   Mint can map and clean up to 800 square feet either in a large open space or by discovering adjacent rooms. In mop mode, the cleaning area is restricted to 250 square feet to optimize cleaning while the cleaning cloth is wet. Sweeps & Mops Mint's dual modes let you easily maintain all your hard surface floors with one device. In Sweep mode, Mint uses a dry sweeping cloth to pick up dust bunnies, pet hair and grit from your floor. In Mop mode, Mint cleans with a pre-moistened cleaning cloth and a special back-and-forth mopping motion to pick up deeper dirt and grime. All it takes to switch modes is a fresh cleaning cloth and a press of a button.  Cleaning Cloths Mint works with commonly available disposable cleaning cloths or with re-usable microfiber cloths. Mint's specially designed microfiber cloths can be re-washed and re-used hundreds of times. Different cloths have been developed to optimize both sweeping and mopping. Flat white microfiber cloths are ideal for attracting dust and dirt while dry sweeping. Textured grey cloths hold water and help loosen and grab deeper grime when mopping. Mint comes with a starter pack of 1 mopping and 2 sweeping cloths. What's in the Box Mint Automatic Floor Cleaner, NorthStar Navigation Cube with 2 C batteries, 2 dry sweeping microfiber cloths, 1 wet mopping microfiber cloth, power adapter, quick start guide, user manual. Backed by a 1 year warranty. Care Instructions To keep your cloths in good shape for hundreds of hours of cleaning, please follow these laundering recommendations:  Machine wash warm. Tumble dry low or air dry. Do not use fabric softener or bleach as these can degrade the cloth fibers over time.  Wet cleaning with microfibers is safe for sealed floor surfaces including tile, vinyl, laminate and sealed hardwood. Disposable pre-moistened cloths are usually safe for the same floor types, but always check the package to make sure they are safe for your floor type.

Ideal for busy professionals and on-the-go families, the microwave oven provides quick and easy meal preparation while nicely accommodating surrounding decor.   Create savory stews and other meals with ease.    The countertop microwave can be installed in the wall using an optional matching trim kit.(Trim kit shown may not represent actual trim kit.)  Inverter Technology Moving Beyond Just \"Heating Things Up\" Many people just use their microwaves for making popcorn or warming up soup because most microwaves just have one temperature setting--high. Conventional microwave ovens might have a low-power setting, but this is achieved by \"pulsing\" the high-power setting on and off rather than by emitting a steady stream of low-powered energy. Panasonic's trailblazing Inverter technology delivers true, variable microwave power, which means even temperatures and consistent textures throughout the food being cooked. The consistent delivery of microwave energy allows delicate foods to simmer without the edges and surfaces overcooking, so foods have the look and taste you expect--without the wait. The Inverter microwave oven perfects the art of cooking, taking microwave cooking to a whole new level. You'll experience delicious food that better retains its color, nutrients, and flavor and that's easier and faster to prepare. Oh, and you can still make great popcorn.  Single, Compact Power Supply Furthermore, the Inverter power unit is smaller and lighter than conventional microwave circuitry (aka the heavy, enclosed side of the microwave), which allows for more interior space to fit that favorite casserole dish, without increasing the oven's overall exterior dimensions. Weighing just 46 pounds, the oven's roomy interior measures 16-3/16 inches long by 16-1/4 inches wide by 9-1/2 inches high, while its compact exterior measures 19-5/16 inches long by 23-7/8 inches wide by 14-13/16 inches high. 4-in-1 Cooking with Convection/Microwave Combination The microwave oven offers four cooking options in just one countertop appliance. Broil food to perfection with the convection setting, which seals in juices and flavors. Bake and brown cakes, pies, and pizzas, courtesy of the circulating, heated air, or get the best of both worlds using the combination option to benefit from the speed of the microwave and the evenness of convection cooking.      Microwave: defrost, cook, or reheat food in minutes.       Bake: bake and brown with circulating heated air.       Broil: heat is quickly forced inside the food, sealing in juices and flavor.       Combination: the speed of microwaving combines with the baking and browning of convection.    Additional Features  One-Touch Genius Sensor Cook and Reheat With the touch of Panasonic's Sensor Cooking button, the microwave takes the guesswork out of creating a great meal, by automatically setting power levels and adjusting cooking or defrosting time. The sensor measures the amount of steam produced during cooking, and signals the microprocessor to calculate the remaining cooking time at the appropriate power level automatically. Inverter Turbo Defrost Panasonic evolved the Turbo Defrost feature, which allows you to defrost foods even faster than previous Panasonic Auto Defrost. Panasonic Inverter Turbo Defrost technology is an advanced microwave sequencing system using the inverter continuous-power delivery method. Menu Action Screen (multi-lingual) The Menu Action Screen is like having a chef to assist you in the kitchen. It scrolls step-by-step cooking instructions across the display, in a choice of English, Spanish, or French. Keep Warm Feature A pulsing delivery of very low microwave power keeps food temperatures at a constant level--without overcooking. So, foods like stew, gravy, and desserts remain warm in the oven until ready to serve. Quick Minute The one-touch button allows you to set or add cooking time in 1-minute increments. Child-Safety Lock   For safety, the oven's child safety lock prevents electronic operation (door still opens).     User-friendly push-button control panel with illuminated dials.    Please Note: upper-left corner of the door has a small indentation to allow the door to open smoothly. Click here to view the set-up guide.

Ice waters down your cocktails, and nobody needs to store that bottle of premium liquor in the freezer. With an exciting Margaritaville design and blue glow light inviting you in for a closer look, the Liquor Chiller uses proprietary technology to super-chill a 750mL bottle of liquor (that's 25 1-ounce servings).

Subjected to higher standards of testing for a superior food grade silicone, European-grade silicone baking pans maintain their elasticity and flexibility longer, and are stronger and more durable to withstand everyday stress and strain, like twisting to unmold and release foods, yet bounce back to their original shape. Their non-stick property is maintained through more uses than other cake molds in an even wider range of temperatures, from -40-degrees to 500-degrees Fahrenheit, for an amazing baking experience every time. Mrs. Anderson\u2019s Silicone Fluted Cake Pan is easy to use. Simply place it on a cookie sheet, pour in cake batter, and bake according to recipe. Great for baking bundt cakes, coffee cake, ambrosia salad, jello recipes, and more. Safe to use from freezer to oven, microwave and dishwasher. BPA free. Includes instructions. Flexible and naturally non-stick to release foods with ease. Dishwasher safe for easy cleanup. Do not use knives, scrapers, brushes or cutters. Never cut in the baking pan.

Sometimes referred to as a low speed juicer, the VRT processes at 80rpm, whereas most other juicers process at a speed of 1,650 to 15,000rpm. The low speed protects and maintains healthy enzymes, prevents oxidation and allows juice to be stored up to 72 hours without degradation. The VRT's dual stage juice processing system extracts the maximum amount of juice from fruits, vegetables, leafy greens, even wheatgrass! Versatile, Easy to Use The patented screw design of the auger is more efficient when squeezing and pressing ingredients to extract juice. The hopper is conveniently located at the top of the juicer. The VRT comes with a pusher to push ingredients into the juicer. Easy to assemble, the hopper attaches to the bowl, which then attaches to the base. The VRT350 also features two spouts and two 64-ounce containers -- one for fresh juice and one for pulp ejection. You can also pour water through the chute to self clean the juicer when changing ingredients. The VRT is compact, taking up very little space on your countertop. This versatile juicer is also easy to clean.   Features  Low speed, masticating style juicing system Juicer processes at 80rpm's, squeezing instead of grinding. This allows the juice to maintain its pure color, natural taste, vitamins and nutrients. Small, vertical footprint takes up less space in your kitchen. Dual stage juicer. First, juice is extracted by crushing the fruit or vegetable. Then, before the pulp is ejected, the pulp is squeezed during the second pressed stage. This results in a higher yield of juice and a very dry pulp. Economical since the juicer is so efficient and productive, you'll get the greatest amount of nutrient rich juice from the least amount of fruits, vegetables, leafy greens. The low speed system limits froth and foam preventing oxidation. Juice can be stored for up to 72 hours without degradation or juice separation. Three settings: On, Off and Reverse. Reverse is an option to use when something is stuck or you need to unclog. Over-sized spout serves up drinks easily.

The Telescope Reach wand extends to 14.4 ft for cleaning stairs and other high reach places.  Patented Dyson Technology Dyson engineers are constantly testing and inventing, trying to find new ways to make their technology work better. As they work, they file patent applications to protect their inventions from copycat manufacturers. That\u2019s why the only place you\u2019ll find Dyson technology is inside a Dyson machine.  Root Cyclone Technology for No Loss of Suction Ordinary vacuum cleaners rely on bags to trap dust and dirt. As you use them, the tiny holes in the bag clog up with particles of dust. This restricts the flow of air, so the vacuum cleaner loses suction. Dyson vacuum cleaners don\u2019t rely on bags to trap dust and dirt. They use patented Root Cyclone technology, which spins the air at incredibly high speeds. The cyclones inside a Dyson vacuum cleaner generate centrifugal forces many thousands of times the force of gravity. Dust, dirt and pet hair are flung out of the airflow and straight into the bin. No bag. No loss of suction.  Features Root Cyclone Technology:  Dyson cyclones capture microscopic particles down to 0.5 microns in size, with no loss of suction. Washable HEPA Filter:  Captures allergens, expels cleaner air. Traps microscopic particles down to 1/5,000 of a pinhead. Particles this small include common household allergens such as pollen, mold spores and dust mites.   Telescope Reach Wand:  Extends 14.4ft with no awkward parts to assemble. The wand assembly has been re-designed to be lightweight and give an additional 4\u201d of reach \u2013 making high reach cleaning easier.   Clear Bin and Hygienic Emptying:  The bin on a Dyson vacuum cleaner is transparent so you can see when it needs emptying \u2013 and just how much dust, dirt and pet hair your new Dyson machine has picked up. It\u2019s made of tough polycarbonate and can be emptied with the press of a button \u2013 minimizing the risk of contact with dirt.   Click-Fit Wand: Accessories can be fitted and removed with a click.   On-Board Accessory Tools: A combination accessory tool and stair tool are included. They store on the machine so they are always to hand.   Certified Asthma and Allergy Friendly:  DC33 Multi Floor is certified asthma and allergy friendly by the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America.   Tough, Durable Construction:  Made from tough polycarbonate, to withstand bumps and bashes.   No Extra Costs:  Other vacuum cleaners are still designed to need replacement bags, belts and filters. Dyson vacuum cleaners don\u2019t need bags and have washable filters, so there are no extra costs.  5-Year Warranty:  Your Dyson vacuum cleaner is likely to take a few knocks and bashes during everyday use \u2013 but that\u2019s nothing compared to what Dyson puts its machines through during testing and development. All Dyson vacuum cleaners undergo a lengthy and rigorous testing program. That\u2019s why DC33 Multi Floor comes with a free 5 year warranty \u2013 parts and labor.

Equipped with an array of user-friendly features, this automatic bread machine by Panasonic makes baking fresh, healthy homemade bread--and much more--easier than ever. Now anyone can enjoy the simple pleasure of freshly baked homemade bread--without the time-consuming efforts normally associated with kneading and baking bread. Just add ingredients, press a few buttons, and it takes care of the rest.     Choose from 2 loaf sizes and light or dark crust colors.  Easily Bake Bread or Create Dough The bread maker mixes, kneads, rises, and bakes bread in two loaf sizes--medium and extra large, plus offers crust color control with light and dark options to accommodate individual preferences. Its digital control panel with a large easy-to-read LCD display makes it simple to select the loaf size and crust shade, as well as the baking mode. Choose from five different modes: Basic, French, Pasta, Pizza Dough, and Bake Only. The Basic mode works well for a variety of breads, including white and whole wheat; French mode bakes up delicious French bread with a soft interior and crispy exterior--perfect for pasta night. Speaking of, Pasta mode makes several different types of homemade pasta dough--there's nothing quite like homemade pasta. Use the Pizza Dough mode for creating homemade pizza dough in just 45 minutes, or use the Bake Only mode when it's time to bake a cake for a birthday celebration or delectable tea breads to serve with tea when visiting with a friend.       Various modes for baking bread or creating dough.  Even more, the bread maker allows for baking a variety of white or whole-wheat bread for slicing and slathering with butter and jam or for making healthy sandwiches to put in the kids' lunches during the week. Or, make bread dough for shaping by hand and baking in the oven. The versatile machine produces delicious results without the additives and preservatives found in store-bought brands. Best of all, the bread maker comes with a programmable timer that can be set up to 13 hours in advance, which means it's possible to wake up in the morning to the smell of freshly baked cinnamon-raisin bread. Or set the timer before leaving for work in the morning so that a warm loaf of rosemary bread will be ready and waiting after a long day at the office. Simply slice it up and serve with dinner.   Automatic raisin dispenser removes for easy cleaning.  Unique Raisin & Nuts Dispenser The bread machine also provides a unique dispenser that automatically drops up to 5.29 ounces (150 grams) of raisins, dried fruits, or nuts into the bread dough at just the right time for thorough, even distribution. When compared to other bread machines, the SD-RD250 turns out loaves with an even scattering of raisins, instead of a clump in one section and bare sections elsewhere. The handy dispenser can also be removed from the machine for convenient washing between uses. Innovative Design for Professional Results Unlike other bread machines, the unit does not offer a viewing window. The absence of a viewing window creates a more even reflection of heat inside the unit, which offers the following three advantages: excellent crust, good rising, and even color. Healthy and Nutritious   Removable nonstick pan with carrying handle. View larger.  Baking bread at home allows for ultimate control over the finished product. By using only the freshest ingredients and making choices from a variety of options, homemade bread can be an important part of a well-balanced diet--for both young and older family members alike. High in fiber and low in fat, bread contains a wealth of beneficial components. It provides complex carbohydrates needed for energy, protein for strong muscles, and vitamins and minerals, including calcium and iron for healthy bones and teeth. Add nutrient-rich eggs to the recipe or choose whole-grain flour for an extra boost of fiber, iron, vitamins, and minerals. Mixing in nuts and dried fruits not only add to the pleasing consistency and taste of the finished product, but they're also another way to add to the overall health factor. Durably Built with Diamond-Fluorine-Coated Baking Pan   Diamond-fluorine coating on scratch-resistant baking pan for enhanced durability.  The bread maker provides an inner bread pan with a generous loop handle for easy removal (use an oven mitt when hot). The rugged pan also features a diamond-fluorine coating for even heating and scratch-resistant, long-lasting use. In fact, the hard diamond particles, which cover both the surface of the kneading blade and the bread pan, are twice as hard as fluorine resin for unbeatable performance. For added convenience, the pan's nonstick interior ensures effortless food release--dough removes without sticking to the pan and fully cooked cakes and loaves of bread slide out smoothly from the pan and onto a cutting board for slicing and serving. The pan's nonstick coating also makes cleanup a snap. The small appliance comes in a slim, compact design that takes up minimal space on the kitchen countertop.

Smashed celeriac Deliciously tasty, almost-mash What a surprisingly simple and comforting veg dish. Unfortunately everyone seems to be completely baffled by celeriac, but it's beautiful in soups or thinly sliced into salads. When roasted it goes sweet and when mixed with potato and mashed it's a complete joy. INGREDIENTS  1 celeriac, peeled Olive oil 1 handful fresh thyme, leaves picked 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped Sea salt Freshly ground black pepper 3-4 tablespoons water or organic stock  METHOD Slice about 1/2-inch off the bottom of your celeriac and roll it on to that flat edge, so it's nice and safe to slice. Slice and dice it all up into 1/2-inch-ish cubes. Don't get your ruler out \u2013 they don't have to be perfect. Put a casserole-type pot on a high heat, add 3 good lugs of olive oil, then add the celeriac, thyme and garlic, with a little seasoning. Stir around to coat and fry quite fast, giving a little colour, for 5 minutes.  Turn the heat down to a simmer, add the water or stock, place a lid on top and cook for around 25 minutes, until tender. Season carefully to taste and stir around with a spoon and smash up the celeriac gently with your Jamie Oliver Masher. Some people like to keep it in cubes, some like to mash it, but I think it looks and tastes much better if you smash it, which is somewhere in the middle. You can serve this with just about any meat you can think of.

After World Kitchen acquired the brand in the late 1990's, CorningWare products were switched to ceramic stoneware production. Introduced later that year was the French White collection, which has been an all-time best seller among brides-to-be.  The CorningWare stoneware collections can be used in conventional, convection and microwave ovens as well for storing food in the refrigerator and freezer. It washes easily by hand or in the dishwasher. Non-porous, stoneware won't absorb food odors and resists staining. And it's non-reactive so acid-based foods can be prepped or baked in it. CorningWare bakeware, a perfect blend of style and function, is designed to be used for convenient same-dish baking and serving, whether for casual or formal dining. The new artisanal-inspired CorningWare etchbakeware collection pays homage to handmade stoneware yet reflects the brand's new expression of shape, texture and technology that display a definitive modernism. The etch bakeware collection features delicate, ribbon-like embossed lines that weave loosely around the base.  4-pc set includes 1 each: 2-1/2-qt Casserole with Glass Cover, 3-qt Oblong and 20-oz Square Dish The collection is designed with gently flared edges and easy-grip handles to make the dishes easy to clean and to handle.

The moisture that humidifiers add to dry air also help alleviate many common nuisances brought on by winter heating such as static electricity, peeling wallpaper, shrinking wood, and cracks in paint and furniture. All Natural, Non Medicated Relief from Dryness, Cough, Cold, and Flu Symptoms. Humidifiers are an ideal choice for relieving the discomforts of nasal congestion, dry itchy skin and hair, chapped lips, nose bleeds, and dry throats. Recent studies by the Center for Disease Control have also shown that relative humidity levels between 43% and 60% helps prevent the movement of germs, including the flu virus. An Adorable Baby Essential is the Perfect Baby Shower Gift! Humidifiers are especially important for Newborns because they are Obligate Nasal Breathers, breathing only through their tiny noses for their first 4 - 6 months. Any congestion can make breathing, feeding, and sleeping incredibly difficult for your little one. Not only that, but many pediatricians recommend the use of a humidifier as a safe, non medicated, all natural alternative to help relieve congestion from the common cold and flu instead of potentially harmful over-the-counter cough and cold medicine. Straightforward, Whisper-Quiet Operation With Clean Control Technology Crane's cheerful designs complement any children's bedroom decor.

Just hang the Eva-Dry unit in a closet or in other small, enclosed spaces and it will start to absorb moisture. There's an indicator window with special \"moisture meter crystals\" that change from blue (when dry) to pink (when wet) to indicate when the unit needs to be renewed. The unit will absorb approximately 8-10 oz. of moisture (depending on humidity levels this should take between 6-8 weeks). Once the moisture has been adsorbed, it cannot leak or spill. This unit uses a specially engineered, crystallized silica gel that is odorless, nontoxic and completely safe. When the indicator crystals turn pink, it's time to renew the unit. Remove the unit from the area where it's adsorbing moisture and plug it into a power outlet in a well-ventilated area. A built-in heater warms the crystals, allowing them to expand and release the moisture as water vapor into the outside air. It takes about 12-14 hrs. to completely renew the unit. When the indicator crystals change from pink to blue, the unit is ready to adsorb another 8-10 oz. of moisture.

How does it work? Yes - To open simply push the press button on the cap, and pull the cap off. To close, push the press button, no need to pump, push cap down onto the body and with this motion the cap volume of air is eliminated, creating a vacuum seal, it\u2019s that simple! Is this a vacuum sealed container? The United States patent office granted us a patent on a vacuum container - Our Vacs create a partial vacuum - The same volume of air as the cap is removed and for human purposes this is enough to keep most goods fresh and edible for long periods of time. For the engineers out there technically speaking there is no vacuum until the cap is pulled upward without pressing the button. Either way the Vacs will keep goods fresher for longer and prevent weevil and bug infestations. This reality is why globally we have sold over 10 million Vacs without advertising. No batteries or electricity required! Are the Vacs smell proof? The Tightvac patented system is able to preserve goods for 1 year and beyond by allowing products to breath and degas. Almost all food goods are smell proof inside the Vacs, however some products like freshly roasted coffee and medical herbs may degas, leaking there odor. Our 2 way valve allows gas build up to slowly escape without letting oxygen in. This is one of the main reasons it can preserve goods for long periods of time. Note: Medical herbs that are sticky and smelly we recommend using a strong zip lock bag inside the Vac. This helps contain the smell and keeps the area clean where the body and the cap meet. This is essential to create a smell proof situation. The sticky resin often created by these products can compromise the open and close system, causing the caps to crack when opening and closing under such pressure of a glue like substance. Keep these areas free from resin buildup. Use a product like Grundge off. Thus maximizing the efficiency of use and longevity of the Vacs. Is it moisture and oxygen free? Yes the Tightvac patented system keeps moisture and oxygen out - these elements cannot enter the container unless you decide to take the cap off. Are the Vacs durable? How long will they last? Yes the Vacs are made with NSF and FDA approved PS # 6, this plastic is very strong. If properly cared for the Vacs can easily last for 10 years. These days shipping methods are very rough, packages being thrown, automated systems dropping huge parcels on top of smaller ones. If your Vac arrives damaged please report this IMMEDIATELY UPON RECEIPT for a part or full replacement. My cap seems loose?  We offer 10 different sizes and 3 styles of Vacs - Solid - Clear and Tint. Often a Solid and Tint Vac will have a slightly looser fitting cap then a clear model. It is a misconception that a tighter fitting cap is working better or holding more of a seal. Loose caps function just as well and will tighten with time and use. How should I clean the Vacs? Hand wash only - Use mild or natural cleaners. Do not microwave or put in dishwasher. Always keep the interior of the cap and the top of the container clean. This will ensure easy open and closure. What does NSF International certified mean? Recognized by regulatory agencies at the local, state, federal and international level, NSF International certification demonstrates that a product complies with all standard requirements. NSF conducts yearly manufacturing facility audits and product testing to verify that the product continues to comply with the standards set by the FDA. In our case all packaging claims have been tested. The plastics we use have been tested for food safety and our manufacturing facility has been visited and complies with all standards.

How does it work? Yes - To open simply push the press button on the cap, and pull the cap off. To close, push the press button, no need to pump, push cap down onto the body and with this motion the cap volume of air is eliminated, creating a vacuum seal, it's that simple! Is this a vacuum sealed container? The United States patent office granted us a patent on a vacuum container - Our Vacs create a partial vacuum - The same volume of air as the cap is removed and for human purposes this is enough to keep most goods fresh and edible for long periods of time. For the engineers out there technically speaking there is no vacuum until the cap is pulled upward without pressing the button. Either way the Vacs will keep goods fresher for longer and prevent weevil and bug infestations. This reality is why globally we have sold over 10 million Vacs without advertising. No batteries or electricity required! Are the Vacs smell proof? The Tightvac patented system is able to preserve goods for 1 year and beyond by allowing products to breath and degas. Almost all food goods are smell proof inside the Vacs, however some products like freshly roasted coffee and medical herbs may degas, leaking there odor. Our 2 way valve allows gas build up to slowly escape - without letting oxygen in. This is one of the main reasons it can preserve goods for long periods of time. Note: Medical herbs that are sticky and smelly we recommend using a strong zip lock bag inside the Vac. This helps contain the smell and keeps the area clean where the body and the cap meet. This is essential to create a smell proof situation. The sticky resin often created by these products can compromise the open and close system, causing the caps to crack when opening and closing under such pressure of a glue like substance. Keep these areas free from resin buildup. Use a product like Grundge off. Thus maximizing the efficiency of use and longevity of the Vacs. Is it moisture and oxygen free? Yes the Tightvac patented system keeps moisture and oxygen out - these elements cannot enter the container unless you decide to take the cap off. Are the Vacs durable? How long will they last? Yes the Vacs are made with NSF and FDA approved PS # 6, this plastic is very strong. These days shipping methods are very rough, packages being thrown, automated systems dropping huge parcels on top of smaller ones. If your Vac arrives damaged please report this IMMEDIATELY UPON RECEIPT for a part or full replacement. My cap seems loose? We offer 10 different sizes and 3 styles of Vacs - Solid - Clear and Tint. Often a Solid and Tint Vac will have a slightly looser fitting cap then a clear model. It is a misconception that a tighter fitting cap is working better or holding more of a seal. Loose caps function just as well and will tighten with time and use. How should I clean the Vacs? Hand wash only - Use mild or natural cleaners. Do not microwave or put in dishwasher. Always keep the interior of the cap and the top of the container clean. This will ensure easy open and closure. What does NSF International certified mean? Recognized by regulatory agencies at the local, state, federal and international level, NSF International certification demonstrates that a product complies with all standard requirements. NSF conducts yearly manufacturing facility audits and product testing to verify that the product continues to comply with the standards set by the FDA. In our case all packaging claims have been tested. The plastics we use have been tested for food safety and our manufacturing facility has been visited and complies with all standards.

Conventional cookware and other ceramic cookware brands achieve their non-stick performance through a coating of PTFE (PolyTetraFluoroEthylene), a synthetic substance that has waxy properties. At very high temperatures, PTFE begins to decompose and release fumes which are documented to be lethal to birds and small pets, and which can be harmful to humans. In addition, traditional pans incorporating PTFE are often manufactured with the aid of PFOA (PerFluoroOctanoic Acid), which the EPA has classified as a 'persistent pollutant of the environment'. With the Green Earth Pan's ecozeri technology, even under high temperatures, such harmful toxic fumes are never released into the environment. This is because the Green Earth Pan by Ozeri utilizes a 100% ceramic coating inspired by nature. The Green Earth Pan's ceramic coating is completely free of PTFE and PFOA. In addition to being eco-friendly and ultra-safe, the Green Earth Pan's ceramic coating is far more durable and scratch-resistant than other non-stick surfaces. With better non-stick properties, the Green Earth Pan by Ozeri allows you to saute, fry, bake, boil and braise with as little as half the amount of oil normally used, and it makes cleaning a breeze. The Green Earth Pan by Ozeri is made of the highest quality die-cast aluminum that allows for even cooking and fantastic browning without the risk of hot spots.

It uses patented Root Cyclone technology for no loss of suction. Weighing in at just 11.6 lbs, it's Dyson's lightest upright, and includes a handle that compresses allowing it to be stored in small spaces. It has a motorized brush bar to remove pet hair and dirt from carpets, and a mini turbine head to clean pet hair and dirt from carpet, upholstery, and the car.    DC24 Animal also includes patented Ball technology, which allows you to steer with ease around obstacles such as furniture and household appliances. It rides on a ball, so there's no pushing back and forth to turn corners.    Patented Dyson Technology  Dyson engineers are constantly testing and inventing, trying to find new ways to make their technology work better. As they work, they file patent applications to protect their inventions from copycat manufacturers. That's why the only place you'll find Dyson technology is inside a Dyson machine.  Root Cyclone technology for No Loss of Suction Ordinary vacuum cleaners rely on bags and filters to trap all the dust and dirt. Air is meant to flow through tiny holes, leaving dust and dirt behind. The problem is that these tiny holes quickly clog up with particles of dust. This chokes the flow of air, so the vacuum cleaner loses suction. Dyson vacuum cleaners don\u2019t rely on bags to trap dust and dirt. They use patented Root Cyclone technology, which spins the air at incredibly high speeds. The cyclones inside a Dyson vacuum cleaner generate centrifugal forces many thousands of times the force of gravity. Dust, dirt and pet hair are flung out of the airflow and straight into the clear bin. No bags, no loss of suction.  Ball Technology to Help You Steer with Ease Have you ever got frustrated pushing an ordinary upright vacuum cleaner back and forth, back and forth to steer around furniture and other obstacles? Have a look underneath it, and you'll see that's because it sits on fixed wheels- perfect if all you want to do is travel in a straight line, but not so good at corners. Frustration is an important source of invention for Dyson engineers as it sparks new ideas and new ways of solving problems. It was their frustration with fixed wheels that led them to develop a new way of turning corners.  Dyson Ball vacuum cleaners use patented Ball technology to overcome the steering limitations of fixed wheels. They ride on a ball, which pivots so you can steer with ease, changing direction with just a turn of the wrist. The idea for Ball technology came about from a Dyson engineer studying new ways to steer. It started crudely - an old wand handle attached to a wheel. Eventually the wheel became a ball - and an ideal home for the motor.  The ball itself is made of glass-reinforced polypropylene, the same material used in crash helmets and riot shields. It combines high impact strength with resistance to distortion. The ball is also where you'll find the motor. By putting the motor inside the ball, at a neutral point, Dyson engineers were able to lower the machine's center of gravity and improve maneuverability even further.        The DC24 Animal includes a motorized brush bar to remove pet hair and dirt from carpets.  Reach out-of-the-way spots        What's In The Box?    DC24 Animal Upright  Vacuum    Operating Manual     Quick Start Guide    Mini Turbine Head    Combination Accessory Tool    Product registration card    5-Year Warranty         Dyson Root Cyclone Technology    Features Motorized brush bar for powerful pet hair removal:  DC24 Animal has a motorized brush bar for removing dirt and pet hair that have lodged deep inside carpets. The stiff bristles on the brush bar spin at high speeds - up to 90 times per second- to agitate the carpet pile and dislodge dirt and pet hair so that it can be vacuumed up and removed. If you also have hard floors or delicate rugs, the brush bar can be turned off so you can use DC24 Animal on these surfaces too.   Mini turbine head tool to clean pet hair from tight spaces: Pet hair doesn\u2019t just accumulate on carpets. It also gets stuck on upholstery, beneath furniture, on stair carpets and inside your car. Powered by your Dyson vacuum's suction, the mini turbine head tool attaches to the wand to remove pet hair from confined spaces. It lets you get into all those awkward spots you couldn't otherwise reach.    Approved for allergy sufferers: All new Dyson upright and canister vacuums are certified asthma & allergy friendly by the Asthma & Allergy Foundation of America.  Reversible wand: Despite its compact size, DC24 Animal has a long reach wand for cleaning stairs and awkward spaces. The wand on DC24 Animal reverses to reach out-of-the-way spots more easily and with a better grip. There are no awkward components to assemble, and you can also attach tools and accessories to extend your cleaning abilities even further.    Clear bin lets you see when it needs emptying:  The bin on a Dyson vacuum cleaner is transparent so you can see when it needs emptying, and just how much dust, dirt and pet hair your new Dyson machine has picked up. Emptying is quick and hygienic- just press the button to release the dirt.   No extra costs:  Other vacuum cleaners are still designed to need replacement bags and filter. Dyson vacuum cleaners don't need bags and have washable filters, so there are no extra costs. Captures allergens, expels cleaner air:  DC24 Animal includes a sealed HEPA (High-Efficiency Particle Air) filter to trap tiny particles as small as 0.1 microns. That\u2019s about the size of a single particle of cigarette smoke. Particles this small include common household allergens such as pollen, mold spores and dust mites. And because the filter is washable you won\u2019t need to replace it. Just give it a rinse once a month with cold water.   5 year parts and labor warranty:  You'd be amazed at some of the tests that Dyson carries out to ensure they're as tough and reliable as possible. During development, a push/pull rig moves Dyson vacuum cleaners a minimum of 5,740,157 feet. The hose is kinked 9,828 times. The bin is opened 1,560 times.

It\u2019s Dyson\u2019s smallest, lightest canister but works like a full-size Dyson machine, with no loss of suction. Each dimension and angle has been recalculated and engineered to make a smaller cyclone as efficient as a big Dyson cyclone. Small and compact, the base fits on a standard letter size sheet of paper \u2013 it\u2019s easy to carry and store. The carbon fiber brush bar is ideal for cleaning short pile carpet, and can be turned off to protect delicate surfaces. The brush bar contains rows of ultra-fine carbon fiber filaments that reduce static and remove fine dust from hard floors. A lifetime washable HEPA filter traps microscopic allergens. DC26 Multi Floor also comes with an articulating hard floor tool that maneuvers easily and cleans narrow gaps.  More About the Dyson DC26 Multi Floor Dyson engineers are constantly testing and inventing, trying to find new ways to make their technology work better. As they work, they file patent applications to protect their inventions from copycat manufacturers. That\u2019s why the only place you\u2019ll find Dyson technology is inside a Dyson machine. Root Cyclone Technology for No Loss of Suction Ordinary vacuum cleaners rely on bags to trap dust and dirt. As you use them, the tiny holes in the bag clog up with particles of dust. This restricts the flow of air, so the vacuum cleaner loses suction. Dyson vacuum cleaners don\u2019t rely on bags to trap dust and dirt. They use patented Root Cyclone\u2122 technology, which spins the air at incredibly high speeds. The cyclones inside a Dyson vacuum cleaner generate centrifugal forces many thousands of times the force of gravity. Dust, dirt and pet hair are flung out of the airflow and straight into the bin. No bag. No loss of suction.        Product Features  Concentrated Root Cyclone technology:  Dyson cyclones capture microscopic particles down to 0.5 microns in size, with no loss of suction.   No extra costs: Other vacuum cleaners are still designed to need replacement bags, belts and filters. Dyson vacuum cleaners don\u2019t need bags and have lifetime washable filters, so there are no extra costs to worry about.   Turbine head with conductive carbon fiber brush bar: The brush bar contains both stiff nylon bristles for removing ground-in dirt from carpets, and ultra fine carbon fiber filaments, engineered to remove fine dust from hard floors. The brush bar is powered by an air driven turbine and is ideal for hard floors and short pile carpets. The floor tool clicks into the back of the machine when not in use for easy storage.  Articulating hard floor tool: Maneuvers easily and cleans narrow gaps.  Extra tools: DC26 Multi Floor also comes with a stair tool and combination brush/crevice tool.  Clear bin and hygienic emptying:  The bin on a Dyson vacuum cleaner is transparent so you can see when it needs emptying \u2013 and just how much dust, dirt and pet hair your new Dyson machine has picked up. It\u2019s made of tough polycarbonate and can be emptied with the press of a button \u2013 minimizing the risk of contact with dirt.   Miniaturized cable rewind:  Smaller and lighter, without compromising cable length of 16ft.  HEPA filter:  Captures allergens, expels cleaner air. Traps microscopic particles down to 1/5,000 of a pinhead. Particles this small include common household allergens such as pollen, mould spores and dust mite feces.  Centralized motor:  Positioned to reduce drag weight. Makes the machine easier to pull along.  Certified asthma and allergy friendly:  DC26 Multi Floor is certified asthma and allergy friendly by the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America.  5 year parts and labor warranty:  Your Dyson vacuum cleaner is likely to take a few knocks and bashes during everyday use \u2013 but that\u2019s nothing compared to what Dyson puts its machines through during testing and development. All Dyson vacuum cleaners undergo a lengthy and rigorous testing program. That\u2019s why DC26 Multi Floor comes with a free 5 year warranty \u2013 parts and labor.     Read more about Dyson  No bags or filters to buy. No extra costs.  Other vacuums are designed to use consumables \u2013 so their manufacturers can make profits selling replacement bags and filters. Dyson vacuums don\u2019t use bags, and they have lifetime washable filters. There are no consumables \u2013 so there are no extra costs.  Only Dyson-patented means Dyson performance Other products may look like Dyson machines, but they don\u2019t work like them. Dyson technology is protected by more than 1,900 patents worldwide to ensure that when you buy a Dyson machine, you get what you expect.  Efficiently engineered \u2013 less bulk, and less waste Dyson machines are tough. But they\u2019re also efficiently engineered. Dyson is always looking for ways to use fewer materials, while at the same time making our machines stronger \u2013 doing more with less.  5 year warranty and a lifetime of support  Dyson's canister vacuums are covered for 5 years parts and labor warranty. But we\u2019ll still be here when yours runs out \u2013 we provide Dyson technology owners with a lifetime of support.
