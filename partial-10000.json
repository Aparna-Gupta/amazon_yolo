Includes a 6.25\" skillet, 7.825\"skillet and 10\" skillet   Universal is one of the oldest names in the cast iron and housewares business. Universal was established in 1842, we originally started with our cast iron food and meat choppers. 15 years ago Universal decided that their next natural decision was to add pre-seasoned cast iron cookware to our already well established cast iron line. When you think of Universal cast iron you think dependability and reliability.   Universal pre-seasoned cookware is ready to use once it enters your kitchen. We have our factory coat each skillet with vegetable oil and bake it at a high temperature to make your cookware a natural and easy-release cooking surface.   The secret to home-style cooking is in the pans you use the Universal 3pc. Skillet Set is just the set your kitchen needs. This set contains 3 of our most popular skillets. Just like the ones Grandma use to have. Best used with a wooden, silicone or nylon utensils.  Care Instructions:  For best results hand wash, dry immediately. To prolong the life of your cookware we do recommend re-seasoning your cookware when needed. If you notice your cookware starts looking dull, gray in color, food starts sticking to the surface of your cookware, or you notice rust, just follow the following steps to re-season your cookware.  How to re-season cookware:  When you wash your cookware make sure you dry it really good. Place aluminum foil to the bottom rack of your oven to catch any dripping during this process. Pre-heat your oven to 350 or 400 degrees. Apply a thin coating of melted vegetable shortening (or cooking oil of your choice) over the entire piece of cookware inside and out. Place cookware upside down on the top rack of the oven. Bake your cast iron cookware for one hour. After one hour shut off your oven and let your cast iron cookware cool off in the oven. Repeat this process as necessary. Once cookware is cool to the touch, store it in a dry place.  What to do if rust occurs:  If rusting occurs, simply scour the rust until it is all gone, clean, dry, and follow the steps for seasoning.  Benefits of Cooking with Cast Iron   Factory Pre-Seasoned and ready to use Seasoning helps prevent rusting Use on most cooking surfaces, grills or campfire Go from the stovetop to oven with ease Flavor Enhancing Superior heat retention and heat distribution Great for searing in natural juices Keeps food warmer longer  Naturally adds iron to foods  Eliminates hot spots  Easy Clean up Professional Results Do not use in the microwave or dishwasher Long Lasting cookware with minimal upkeep   ", "salesrank_2018": "48599"}, "B000VTRKOE": {"description": "Rev-A-Shelf's RV units are a perfect way to clear your kitchen of unsightly trash by hiding it inside your cabinet.

In the top of the bench sharpening unit, a rotating axis holds the stones firmly in place, protecting them against breakage, and bringing the desired stone into position for sharpening. The base of the sharpening unit is a reservoir that allows submersion of the unused stones, keeping them clean and saturated. The angle guide helps to position a tool correctly for sharpening. The three stones in this system are used sequentially to restore cutting edges on straight-edged tools, such as chisels, plane blades, and precision instruments; the100-grit silicon carbide stone is suitable for repairing a cutting edge, while the 150-grit silicon carbide stone is suitable for sharpening and maintaining the edge, and the 320-grit aluminum oxide stone produces a honed cutting edge. The sharpening stone oil meets FDA requirements for use near food, and consists of pharmacopeia-grade mineral oil formulated with the correct lubricity for oilstone sharpening. It prevents metal from bonding with the abrasive surface by flushing away dislodged abrasive and metal chips. Each stone is also prefilled with oil to save time and eliminate the need to presoak it prior to use. The silicon carbide stones are fast-cutting and offer effective sharpening, even under light pressure. The aluminum oxide stone has a tough fracture- and wear-resistant grit that is more durable than silicon carbide and capable of sharpening to very close tolerances. Each stone is created by grading the material to a consistent particle size and blending it with bonding agents. It is then molded and surface-finished. These 3/8 x 8 x 2 inch (H x W x D) oilstones, which are suitable for bench use, are harder and more durable than a waterstone. (H is height, the vertical distance from lowest to highest point; W is width, the horizontal distance from left to right; D is depth, the horizontal distance from front to back.) They conform to the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) abrasive grit standard. Sharpening stones, or whetstones, are abrasive surfaces used to sharpen and hone the edges of steel cutting implements, such as chisels, knives, scissors, hand scrapers, and plane blades. Sharpening is the process of creating or re-establishing a cutting edge by grinding away portions of the metal to adjust the angle of the edge and reform the shape. Honing removes small imperfections. Stones can be flat, for working flat edges, or shaped, for edges that are more complex. Sharpening stones are made of natural or synthetic materials that range from softer to harder, and are categorized by the size of their abrasive particles, known as grit. A stone with a coarser grit is used when more metal needs to be removed (e.g., when sharpening a nicked or very dull blade); the stone with the finest grit produces the sharpest edge. Where numbers are assigned to specify grit, they range from coarser grit (low) to finer grit (high). Some sharpening stones are designed for use with a lubricating liquid, some can be used dry, and others can be used either wet or dry. When used with lubricating liquid, a sharpening stone can be called a waterstone or an oilstone, based on the lubricant required.

Due to this uniqueness, there may be slight variations from piece to piece. Le Creuset Stoneware is safe for use in the microwave, freezer, refrigerator, dishwasher, oven and broiler. The maximum oven-safe temperature is 500 degrees F / 260 degrees C. The enameled surface is easy to clean and scratch-resistant. The enamel is completely hygienic and will not absorb odors or flavors. Le Creuset Stoneware is extremely strong and durable, and resists staining, chipping and cracking. The handles, knobs and rims have been designed for a secure, easy-to-hold grip. Cleaning and Care DO NOT use any Stoneware piece on the stovetop or any other direct heat source. OVEN: Maximum oven-safe temperature is 500 degrees F / 260 degrees C. Use oven mitts for lifting at all times. BROILER: When using under a broiler allow a gap of no less than 2-1/2 inches between the rim of the dish and the heat source. MICROWAVE: Handles may become hot during prolonged microwave use, especially if the handles are enclosed with plastic wrap. Cover just the open top of the dish, leaving the handles exposed. FREEZER-TO-OVEN USE: Do not place a frozen dish of food in a preheated oven. Place the frozen dish in a cold oven and set the temperature, allowing the dish and oven to heat together. Before serving always check that the center of the food is completely and uniformly hot. CLEANING: Before the first use, wash the dish in hot, soapy water, and rinse and dry thoroughly. For most day-to-day cleaning, cool the dish for a few minutes before washing and drying, or wash in the dishwasher, allowing the full cycle to complete. Never leave a dish fully immersed in water. For removal of stubborn residues allow the dish to cool, fill with warm, soapy water and allow it to soak for 10 to 20 minutes. Wash in the usual way using a plastic brush or scouring pad if necessary.

Espresso is generally thicker and more highly concentrated than coffee brewed by other methods, often featuring a creamy foam on top. Espresso was invented in Italy at the beginning of the 20th century by Luigi Bezzera. Bezzera invented a method of creating coffee using steam pressure, providing a quick way to make a single cup of coffee. The original Italian name meant \"pressed coffee,\" with a connotation of speed and efficiency EXCEPTIONAL DESIGN: The Primula 3-Cup Aluminum Espresso Maker features a modern, stylish design with a high-quality aluminum body. The handle is made from a heat resistant plastic that not only provides you with a firm and reliable grip, but also allows your hand to stay cool during use. Its efficient layout forces pressurized water through coffee grounds, and deposits a rich, full bodied espresso blend into the serving chamber FIRST USE INSTRUCTIONS: Unscrew the top and remove the filter funnel from the base. Locate the filter plate and rubber washer, and remove both. Wash all parts in hot water and then reassemble. It is recommended that your first espresso be thrown away as to ensure the optimal taste of ensuing brews SUBSEQUENT USES AND CLEANING: To use, fill the base with fresh water up to the level of the safety valve and insert the filter funnel. Fill the filter funnel with finely ground coffee (do not press down), and screw the assembled top firmly to the base. Place the espresso maker on low to medium heat, and within 3-5 minutes, delicious espresso will fill the serving chamber. Serve immediately. To clean, hand wash only.

Dust mites survive on dead skin cells and bodily fluids that are abundant in your bed. Allergic reactions are caused by the waste and skin these dust mites leave behind.

AirBake brand has always been \"The Original Insulated Bakeware\". AirBake continues to provide the best baking results every time. Made of 100-percent aluminum, AirBake Natural provides an overall enhanced baking performance with its insulated aluminum sheets and micro-dome technology to decrease bake times by up to 15% over traditional insulated bakeware. Two heavyweight aluminum sheets surround a layer of air. The air reduces the temperature of the metal that comes in contact with the food. The bottom sheet blocks the direct oven heat while the layer of air acts as an insulator preventing the top sheet from overheating. This means better browning, no burning, and moister baked goods. Set includes Small and Medium pizza pans. CARE INSTRUCTIONS: Before using your bakeware for the first time, wash and condition the bakeware by spreading one teaspoon of cooking oil over the interior with a clean cloth. Wipe off any excess. Avoid overheating your bakeware. In order to preserve and avoid scratches on your coating, we recommend the use of plastic utensils. Slight surface marks or abrasions are normal and will not affect the performance of the non-stick coating. With use, the non-stick surface may become slightly darker. This will not impair its performance. AirBake is designed to breathe and is not watertight. However, AirBake is dishwasher safe. DO NOT USE DISHWASHER DETERGENT TABS - the concentrated cleaning agents will damage the bakeware's finish. DO NOT SOAK - if water is inside pan layer, there is a risk of burning from steam release. If your pan has water inside the two sheets, place the pan upside down in a 250-degree oven for 30 minutes or until water is removed.", "salesrank_2018": "242683"}, "B00132J8RA": {"description": "Krups, the world-wide leader of small appliances, and Heineken, the leader in European premium imported beer, have partnered together to create the ultimate beer-drinking experience at home. Compatible with the Heineken DraughtKeg and the Heineken Premium Light DraughtKeg, this beautifully designed beer-tap system features a silent cooling system that delivers constant and consistent cooling, keeping the 5L keg at the ideal temperature of 41 degrees F. Simple to operate, just place a pre-cooled Heineken DraughtKeg into the machine, position the keg's plastic tube into the spout, close the lid, and it's ready to go. Inserting a keg takes less than 15 seconds. Even more, the unit automatically pressurizes the keg, releasing Co2 every time the tap opens, to ensure the beer remains fresh for up to 30 days--plus it allows for a crisp, quality beer with Heinekens' signature head of foam and trademark \"bite\". Other highlights include an LCD display with a volume indicator, freshness indicator, and temperature-control indicator; as well as a detachable pour handle, detachable draw spout, and a removable tray for easy cleanup. Ideal for football-viewing parties, game rooms, or poker night with friends, the compact beer-tap system measures 17-4/5 by 13-1/2 by 13-1/2 inches.

An innovative ultra quiet chilling technology maintains the beer at the perfect serving temperature. The BeerTender and DraughtKeg connect through a patented interface.

That is why Heineken always has been and still is served in a very specific way. Known as \"The Heineken Perfect Pour,\" the technique delivers a perfect glass of Heineken--one that has a soft, freshly skimmed white head of two fingers\u2019 width, at a temperature of 38 degrees Fahrenheit. A perfect Heineken should have a head that aligns perfectly with the horizontal line of the red star on the glass. Follow these steps:  Select a clean Heineken glass and rinse in cold water. The glass should be rinsed until you feel the glass chilled in your hand (do not place in refrigerator or freezer). Tilt the glass at a 45 degree angle and open the tap all with one smooth motion. Make sure that the foam is generated within the base of the glass initially and then run the beer under the foam. Align the head with the star: straighten the glass at 3/4 full. Make sure the tap doesn\u2019t touch the beer and that the bottom of the head should line up with the horizontal line in the Heineken red star on the glass. Skim it: sit the glass to the side of the tap on the drip tray. Wet your skimmer, hold it at a 45 degree angle and scrape the top of the glass in one single smooth movement. By shaving off the excess foam the head is sealed and carbonation is prevented from leaving the beer. This makes the beer last longer and also seals in the flavor.     The Right Glass: The Heineken Glass Story       In Amsterdam, draught beer is served in smaller 8-ounce galaxy glasses by the round, so friends can enjoy Heineken together. Smaller glasses ensure fresher, colder beer and sharing with friends creates a warm social vibe that the Dutch call \"Gezellig.\" Glassware needs to be \"beer clean,\" meaning that it is only washed with non-petroleum-based cleaners and washed separately from food dishes that would expose it to any oils or grease. Oil and grease are natural enemies of beer, and will quickly disintegrate the foam head that contributes to the flavor, not to mention the beauty of a perfectly poured draught beer. To prevent beer from being contaminated, stick to the golden rule--use beer glasses for beer only.

Zassenhaus products are distinctive and unique and solidify our position as the leading supplier of premium spice and coffee mills. A mill is as good as its grinding mechanism as this alone determines how much flavor and aroma is released when the spices are ground.

The original design of the 5.1-inch Speyer Pepper Mill dates back over 100 years.

And unlike steel, whose blades corrode and become dull over time, the CeraPlus grinding mechanism is guaranteed for 25 years of flawless service.

It has been engineered for powerful cleaning of every floor surface, with a motorized brush bar that can be turned off for hard floors and delicate rugs. DC25 Multi floor also includes patented Ball technology, which allows you to steer with ease around obstacles such as furniture and household appliances. It rides on a ball, so there's no more pushing back and forth to turn corners. At just 16.12 lbs, DC25 Multi floor is one of Dyson's lightest full-size uprights. Patented Dyson TechnologyDyson engineers are constantly testing and inventing, trying to find new ways to make their technology work better. As they work, they file patent applications to protect their inventions from copycat manufacturers. That's why the only place you'll find Dyson technology is inside a Dyson machine.  DC25 Multi floor uses the following patented Dyson technologies:Dyson\u2019s patented Root Cyclone technology Root Cyclone Technology, for no loss of suctionOrdinary vacuum cleaners rely on bags and filters to trap dust and dirt. Air is meant to flow through tiny holes, leaving dust and dirt behind. The problem is that these tiny holes quickly clog up with particles of dust. This chokes the flow of air, so the vacuum cleaner loses suction. Dyson vacuum cleaners don't rely on bags to trap dust and dirt. They use patented Root Cyclone technology, which spins the air at incredibly high speeds. The cyclones inside a Dyson vacuum cleaner generate centrifugal forces many thousands of times the force of gravity. Dust, dirt and pet hair are flung out of the airflow and straight into the clear bin. No bags, no loss of suction. Ball Technology, to help you steer with easeThe motor of the DC25 is located inside the ball for a lower center of gravity Have you ever gotten frustrated pushing an ordinary upright vacuum cleaner back and forth, back and forth to steer around furniture and other obstacles? Have a look underneath it, and you'll see that's because it sits on fixed wheels \u2013 perfect if all you want to do is travel in a straight line, but not so good at corners. Frustration is an important source of invention for Dyson engineers \u2013 it sparks new ideas, new ways of solving problems. It was their frustration with fixed wheels that led them to develop a new way of turning corners. Dyson Ball upright vacuum cleaners use patented Ball technology to overcome the steering limitations of fixed wheels. They ride on a ball, which pivots around itself, so you can steer with ease, changing direction with just a turn of the wrist. The idea for Ball technology came about from a Dyson engineer studying new ways to steer. It started crudely - an old wand handle attached to a wheel. Eventually the wheel became a ball- an ideal home for the motor. The ball itself is made of glass-reinforced polypropylene \u2013 the same material used in the manufacture of car dashboards. It combines high impact strength with resistance to distortion. The ball is also where you'll find the motor. By putting the motor inside the ball, at a neutral point, Dyson engineers were able to lower the machine's center of gravity and improve maneuverability even more.  DC25 Multi-Floor Product Features:The motorized brush bar spins up to 90 times per second to dislodge dirt and pet hair 1. Motorized Brush Bar, for powerful pet hair removal.DC25 Multi-Floor has a motorized brush bar for removing dirt and pet hair that have lodged deep inside carpets. The stiff bristles on the brush bar spin at high speeds - up to 90 times per second \u2013 to agitate the carpet pile and dislodge dirt and pet hair so that it can be vacuumed up and removed. If you also have hard floors or delicate rugs, the brush bar can be turned off so you can use DC25 Multi-Floor on these surfaces too. The Telescope Reach Wand instantly extends to 16 ft for high-reach cleaning.2. Quick-draw Telescope Reach Wand, for cleaning stairs and other high-reach areas.When you want to clean hard-to-reach spots like stairs and ceilings, you can use the quick-release wand on your DC25 Multi-Floor. The single-action wand nstantly extends to 16 ft, with no awkward components to assemble. You can also attach tools and accessories, extending your cleaning abilities even further. 3. Washable HEPA filter captures allergens, expels cleaner air.DC25 Multi-Floor includes a sealed HEPA (High-Efficiency Particle Air) filter to trap tiny particles as small as 0.1 microns. That\u2019s about the size of a single particle of cigarette smoke. Particles this small include common household allergens such as pollen, mold spores and dust mites. And because the filter is washable you won\u2019t need to replace it. Just give it a rinse once a month with cold water. The bin empties hygienically with a push of a button.4. Clear bin lets you see when it needs emptying.The bin on a Dyson vacuum cleaner is transparent so you can see when it needs emptying \u2013 and just how much dust, dirt, and pet hair your new Dyson machine has picked up. Emptying is quick and hygienic \u2013 just press the button to release the dirt. 5. Approved for allergy sufferers.All new Dyson upright and canister vacuums are certified asthma & allergy friendly by the Asthma & Allergy Foundation of America. 6. No extra costs.Other vacuum cleaners are still designed to need replacement bags and filter. Dyson vacuum cleaners don't need bags and have washable filters, so there are no extra costs. 7. 5-year parts and labor warrantyYou'd be amazed at some of the tests that Dyson carries out to ensure they're as tough and reliable as possible. During development, a push/pull rig moves Dyson vacuum cleaners a minimum of 5,740,157 feet. The hose is kinked 9,828 times. The bin is opened 1,560 times. Upright vacuum cleaners undergo 212 different validation tests, canisters 240. That's why Dyson are so confident in their machines - they warranty all new uprights and canisters for 5 years, parts and labor.

Reconfigured air channels and improved flow efficiency reduce turbulence and preserve air pressure, so that the inner cyclones can extract more microscopic particles. These refinements help remove more dirt, dust, allergens and pet hair for the airflow.  Ball Technology to Help You Steer with Ease Have you ever gotten frustrated pushing an ordinary upright vacuum cleaner back and forth, back and forth to steer around furniture and other obstacles? Have a look underneath it, and you'll see that's because it sits on fixed wheels \u2013 perfect if all you want to do is travel in a straight line, but not so good at corners. Frustration is an important source of invention for Dyson engineers \u2013 it sparks new ideas, and new ways of solving problems. It was their frustration with fixed wheels that led them to develop a new way of turning corners.    Dyson Ball vacuum cleaners use patented Ball technology to overcome the steering limitations of fixed wheels. They ride on a ball, which pivots around itself so you can steer with ease, changing direction with just a turn of the wrist. The idea for Ball technology came about from a Dyson engineer studying new ways to steer. It started crudely - an old wand handle attached to a wheel. Eventually the wheel became a ball - and an ideal home for the motor.  The ball itself is made of glass-reinforced polypropylene \u2013 the same material used in the manufacture of car dashboards. It combines high impact strength with resistance to distortion. The ball is also where you'll find the motor. By putting the motor inside the ball, at a neutral point, Dyson engineers were able to lower the machine's center of gravity and improve maneuverability even further.      The DC24 includes a motorized brush bar to remove pet hair and dirt from carpets The wand reverses to reach out-of-the-way spots more easily and with a better grip        What's In The Box?    DC24 Multi Floor Vacuum    Operating Manual    Quickstart Guide    Combination Accessory Tool    Product Registration Card    5-Year Warranty         Dyson Root Cyclone Technology    Features Motorized brush bar for powerful pet hair removal :  DC24 Multi Floor has a motorized brush bar for removing dirt and pet hair that have lodged deep inside carpets. The stiff bristles on the brush bar spin at high speeds - up to 90 times per second \u2013 to agitate the carpet pile and dislodge dirt and pet hair so that it can be vacuumed up and removed. If you also have hard floors or delicate rugs, the brush bar can be turned off so you can use DC24 Multi Floor on these surfaces too.  Captures allergens, expels cleaner air: DC24 Multi floor includes a sealed HEPA (High-Efficiency Particle Air) filter to trap tiny particles as small as 0.1 microns. That\u2019s about the size of a single particle of cigarette smoke. Particles this small include common household allergens such as pollen, mold spores and dust mites. And because the filter is washable you won\u2019t need to replace it. Just give it a rinse once a month with cold water.   Reversible wand: Despite its compact size, DC24 Multi Floor has a long reach wand for cleaning stairs and awkward spaces. The wand on DC24 Multi Floor reverses to reach out-of-the-way spots more easily and with a better grip. There are no awkward components to assemble, and you can also attach tools and accessories to extend your cleaning abilities even further.    Clear bin lets you see when it needs emptying: The bin on a Dyson vacuum cleaner is transparent so you can see when it needs emptying, and just how much dust, dirt and pet hair your new Dyson machine has picked up. Emptying is quick and hygienic- just press the button to release the dirt.   No extra costs:  Other vacuum cleaners are still designed to need replacement bags and filter. Dyson vacuum cleaners don't need bags and have washable filters, so there are no extra costs. Approved for allergy sufferers:  All new Dyson upright and canister vacuums are certified asthma & allergy friendly by the Asthma & Allergy Foundation of America.  5 year parts and labor warranty:  You'd be amazed at some of the tests that Dyson carries out to ensure they're as tough and reliable as possible. During development, a push/pull rig moves Dyson vacuum cleaners a minimum of 5,740,157 feet. The hose is kinked 9,828 times. The bin is opened 1,560 times. Upright vacuum cleaners undergo 212 different validation tests, canisters 240. That's why Dyson are so confident in their machines- they warranty all new uprights and canisters for 5 years parts and labor.

With the Easiyo system, you'll use the Yogurt Maker and Easiyo Base and Culture sachets (sold separately) to create fresh yogurt whenever you want it. Easiyo is not only the freshest yogurt you can get--with more beneficial live cultures in every spoonful (probiotic cultures that you need for your digestive and immune health)--it contains no artificial ingredients and more calcium than store bought yogurt. Each batch makes 35oz of fresh yogurt. Where other home yogurt makers require the pre-heating of ingredients, thermometers, and other attention, the Easiyo Yogurt Maker utilizes a unique baffle system that produces the controlled heat needed to activate all the lactic cultures present in the Easiyo Base and Culture sachets. To make your Easiyo yogurt, just follow three simple steps:  Half-fill the yogurt jar with cold drinking water. Thoroughly mix in the contents of an Easiyo sachet (add 2 to 4 tablespoons sugar if desired). Top up with more cold water. Replace lid and re-shake.  Push the baffle down inside the Yogurt Maker as far as it will go. Pour boiling water into the Yogurt Maker to the top of the red baffle only.  Place jar inside. The boiling water will rise up around the base of the jar. Put lid on Yogurt Maker. Leave a minimum of 6 to 8 hours or overnight until set. Then store the yogurt jar in the refrigerator (40 degrees F).      Step 1. Step 2. Step 3.    Always use a new Easiyo sachet to ensure all the lactic cultures are present in your yogurt every time.

Our new line of Burgundy Clay Flame-Top ceramics products work directly on a gas flame or an electric or halogen hob without a diffuser, without any fear of cracking or breaking. Much lighter, (30% lighter), than many types of comparable metal cookware products, Flame-Top is microwave and dishwasher-safe, cleans up very easily, is extremely strong and durable, goes under the broiler, and can go directly from a freezer or a refrigerator to a hot oven to the table, where it will retain the cooking heat for a very long time. Unlike most metal cookware products, Flame-Top cookware can sit on a very hot open flame for an extended period of time without any ingredients in the cook pot, and they will not crack, discolor or break. Perfect for braising, browning and slow cooking due to the incredibly gentle heat distribution properties of Burgundy Clay, Flame-Top products cook evenly and thoroughly when used on top of the stove, in the oven or even in the microwave. Enhancing this gentle cooking action are raised dots on the underneath side of each lid that evenly distribute evaporated juices directly back into the cooking food. This self-basting technique produces a more thoroughly cooked, tender and moist dish than with traditional lids, which force liquids to run down the sides of the pot, and which contribute to even cooking.
