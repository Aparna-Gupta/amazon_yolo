The moisture that humidifiers add to dry air also help alleviate many common nuisances brought on by winter heating such as static electricity, peeling wallpaper, shrinking wood, and cracks in paint and furniture. All Natural, Non Medicated Relief from Dryness, Cough, Cold, and Flu Symptoms. Humidifiers are an ideal choice for relieving the discomforts of nasal congestion, dry itchy skin and hair, chapped lips, nose bleeds, and dry throats.

Use it to quickly and effortlessly chop, cube, slice, dice, and more. Its wide blade also makes it possible to scoop cut pieces and transfer them from a cutting board to awaiting pots or bowls. Overall, the Santoku knife measures approximately 11 by 1 by 3 inches. As part of Shun's Ken Onion collection, the knife shares the same high-quality materials as the Shun Classic line, but in a curvier form. Its enticing beauty starts with a VG-10 stainless-steel blade, which features 16 layers of SUS410/SUS431 stainless steel on each side, producing a 33 layered Damascus look, but without the rusting problems associated with Damascus. The Damascus detailing not only enhances the knife's aesthetic appeal, but it also prevents morsels from sticking and helps maintain the integrity of food when slicing. The knife's sleek good looks continue on into its ebony PakkaWood handle, which offers a generously arched, ergonomic shape that fits comfortably in the palm of the hand for enhanced comfort and control. The knife's wide, gently rounded bolster also helps ensure the correct grip, which alleviates hand strain even with large food-prep tasks. Made in Japan, the knife carries a limited lifetime warranty and should be hand washed for best results.  From the Manufacturer    Curved blade belly for versatility when working at a variety of heights.  Ken Onion Series Why Buy Shun Classic Ken Onion As part of the Shun Classic line, the Shun Classic Ken Onion Series shares the same materials and Pattern Damascus clad blades as Shun Classic. But the Ken Onion series elevates ergonomics to an art form. Every aspect, from the shape of the blade to the way the handle fits snugly into the user's hand, has been designed for superlative comfort and control. The arc of the sleek Pakkawood handle provides stability, while the rock of the blade's belly enables users of any height to cut with ease and control. The widened bolster guides users to the correct grip and reduces tension during cutting, making this line ideal for users who have large quantities of prep work or those who suffer from arthritis or carpal tunnel syndrome. NSF certified for use in commercial kitchens. Detailed Features   Similar to the Shun Classic line, but with a curvier profile.   Designed by Ken Onion, one of the most revered custom knife designers in the world. Ken has won more knife design awards than any other single blade designer. Designed by a man with no culinary experience, an advantage because he addressed the needs of chefs from a fresh perspective with no preconceived notions. The handsome, stick-resistant blade is combined with Ken Onion's signature ergonomic handle design and unique blade sweep found only in a Ken Onion knife. The shape of the blade is designed to maximize the glide of the blade across the cutting board, making it easy for chefs of any height to use without shoulder tension. Blunted blade nose, like that of a Santoku, allows the cook to scoop chopped ingredients off of the board. Ambidextrous handle design and stability bump on the lower portion of the handle provide maximum comfort and confidence while cutting. Inner curve on each side of the bolster forms perfect thumb and index finger rests; widened bolster releases tension in forearm. Knife is \"zero balanced\" at this center point, another distinctive ergonomic feature. Handle is curved downward to more closely match the shape of the palm, eliminating gaps between the hand and the handle. Handles are slightly elevated to allow for full contact between the knife and the cutting surface without the cook's knuckles getting in the way. Many of the 37 steps required to manufacture these truly unique knives utilize extensive hand crafting techniques, requiring trained craftsmen. Hand wash and dry recommended; limited lifetime warranty.    World-renown knife designer, Ken Onion.  Ken Onion Contrary to rumor, Ken Onion knives are not named for the singular task of chopping onions. That's really the designer's last name. Ken is one of the most sought-after custom knife makers in the world. He has won more knife awards for design than any other single designer, and with the partnership of Kershaw he has done more to change the pocket knife industry than any other individual. His custom knives can be found in some of the most prestigious private knife collections as well as in the pockets of his multitude of fans. Kasumi Method of Knifemaking Kasumi is a traditional Japanese style of knifemaking in which an extremely hard core of high-carbon steel is clad--that is, sheathed or covered--with an exterior jacket of another steel. The somewhat \"softer\" exterior cladding protects the inner cutting core. In Japanese, kasumi means \"mist\" and is so called because the exterior steel can have a lovely misty appearance when compared to the harder cutting core. Kasumi construction provides an ultimate mix of properties: an extremely sharp edge and ease of sharpening. This clad construction is similar to how samurai swords are traditionally made.

Dual wire whips spin independently as they rotate around the bowl, creating triple whipping action and allowing you to whip as little as one egg white into over a cup of meringue. Wire whips are designed to aerate light or pourable mixtures and batters, mash cooked potatoes, or shred hot, cooked meats in seconds.

Knead as little as one loaf of bread (3 cups flour) or up to 14 1-pound loaves, with either white or whole grain flour. The powerful belt-driven transmission delivers adequate torque to knead light or heavy loads without overheating or bogging down. The dough hook can also mix up to 34 dozen cookies in a single batch.

Although Victorinox is known the world over as the creator of the Original Swiss Army Knife, the company started out in 1884 as a cutlery workshop. By the time company creator Karl Elsener delivered his first pocket knife to the Swiss Army, his cutlery business was already booming. Over the next century, Victorinox cutlery became a top-rated choice among professionals worldwide, with over 300 blades to offer.  Victorinox knives have regularly appeared as highly ranked and recommended kitchen tools in Cook's Illustrated, Men's Health, The Cincinnati Enquirer, New York Magazine, and Natural Health, just to name a few. In 2009, the company announced a partnership with professional chef, Daniel Humm, of Eleven Madison Park in New York City. In addition, building on the success of its cutlery business, Victorinox has brought all the same quality and expertise to a wider range of products and accessories, including other kitchen tools, pocket tools, watches, luggage, and clothing. Who is R.H. Forschner? Victorinox had been a staple in European commercial cutlery for over 50 years when approached by New York's R.H. Forschner, known since 1855 as a builder of scales for butchers, to be their sole cutlery supplier. The two companies joined forces in 1937, and R.H. Forschner subsequently became North America's dominant professional brand, as ubiquitous in the bustling meatpacking plants of the Midwest as it is in the gleaming, four-star restaurant kitchens of Midtown Manhattan.  As a division of Victorinox/Swiss Army Brands, R.H. Forschner marketed cutlery under the brand name \"RH Forschner by Victorinox\" and distributed to the commercial, food service, and retail trade classes. That brand has been considered a top choice of professionals worldwide with over 300 styles of blades bearing the R.H. Forschner name. However, in 2009, in conjunction with Victorinox's 125th anniversary, the company, Victorinox Swiss Army, Inc., has decided to remove the \"RH Forschner\" name from all blades. Blades thenceforth only include the \"Victorinox\" name.  What is a stamped blade? A stamped knife can usually be identified by the absence of a bolster. Stamped blades are cut into their shapes from cold-rolled pieces of steel and then ground, tempered, and sharpened. Creating them requires many less steps than forging and results in lighter, narrower blades. Some professionals prefer the thicker, heavier forged blades, but many pros, who spend much of their day cutting and slicing, enjoy a lighter knife since it's less fatiguing and easier to manipulate at speed.  Stamped knives are easier to produce and therefore less expensive. They perform very well and can approach the quality of a forged blade, but not the weight or feel. Victorinox manufactures a complete range of stamped blades with unique, patented Fibrox handles and they are considered among the greatest values in the knife industry.  What knives do I need to own? Knife choice or selection is determined by many factors--size, function, style, and preference. The most important factor is function. Different knives have different uses. It is important to use the proper knife for a specific task, since proper knife selection and the use of a proper-sized, sharp knife make for safe cutting. General kitchen tasks and the knife to use for them are as follows:  Paring: The most common to own and use, a paring knife is generally for small cutting jobs and peeling of vegetables or fruit. The blade size is usually from three to four inches. Choose the shape and size to fit your hand. Since this is one of the more versatile knives, owning more than one is recommended. Chef's: The most important tool and essential to every cook, a chef's knife is most often used in a rocking method to mince, dice, and chop vegetables and herbs. This one is known as the chef's best friend. Slicer: Most commonly used to slice meats, poultry, and seafood, the slicer is an important companion to any host or hostess. Boning: As its name suggests, a boning knife is used to trim or remove meat and fish from the bone. Bread: Designed with a special edge, a bread knife makes easy work of cutting through crusty bread, pastries, or any item with a crust and a soft interior. Fillet: Most often used by pros and seasoned home chefs, the fillet knife is used to fillet meat and fish. Cleaver: An important addition to any collection, a cleaver is often used to cut or chop through bones. Santoku: This knife combines the features of a cleaver with a chef's knife. The curved blade helps the rocking motion used for chopping, and the wide blade works well for scooping sliced food off a cutting board and for crushing garlic. The santoku can also be used to slice meat and has a narrow spine for making thin cuts. Utility: An all-purpose knife often referred to as a sandwich knife, the utility knife peels and slices fruits and vegetables, and even carves small meats. Shaping: With its curved blade, a shaping knife is great for small precision cuts where control is essential, such as peeling, trimming, or garnishing.  What are the different knife edges and what do they do? Straight: The vast majority of Victorinox knives come with a straight or fine edge. This means it has a perfect taper along the blade and no serrations. It is designed to cut without tearing or shredding. Serrated: An edge designed with small, jagged teeth along the edge. Scalloped: A blade with waves along the edge generally used to cut breads with a hard crust and soft interior, as well as tougher-skinned fruits and vegetables. Granton: This edge has hollowed-out grooves or dimples on the sides of the blade. These grooves fill with the fat and juices of the product being cut, allowing for thin, even cuts without tearing. Even with the grooves, these are still straight-edge knives and can be honed with a sharpening steel.  How should I care for my cutlery?  After use, knives should not be allowed to soak in water. The best practice is to hand wash and dry them immediately. This is especially true if they have been used on fruit or salty foods, which may cause some staining, even on stainless steel. Most knives require very little maintenance and it is worth the effort to protect your investment.  Though Victorinox knives are dishwasher safe, this is strongly discouraged. The dishwasher's agitation may cause damage. Additionally, harsh detergents can be harmful and cause pitting and spotting on the blades. The handles may also discolor and develop a white film with constant use of the dishwasher. Plus, intense heat associated with dishwashers is not good for the temper of the blade.  How do I keep my knives sharp? All quality knives require proper maintenance to keep them in perfect cutting shape. The best of edges will quickly dull if it strikes metal, glass, or Formica. A wooden cutting board makes the best cutting surface. And, if a slip occurs, a proper cutting board is safer for the user. Frequent use of a Victorinox sharpening steel will keep blades in tip top working condition. All straight-edge knives need steeling to keep their edges. How to \"Steel\" a Knife Steeling a Knife Hold the steel firmly in your left hand with the guard positioned to stop the blade should it slip.Hold the knife in your right hand and place on top part of steel as shown.Raise back of blade one-eighth inch.Now, moving the blade only, draw it across the steel in an arching curve, pivoted at your wrist. The blade tip should leave the steel about two-thirds of the way down.Repeat the same action with the Blade on the bottom side of the steel. Always maintain the same pressure and angle on both sides of the steel.Repeat five or six times.  How should I store my knives?  Safety is the biggest concern of storage, both to the user and to protect the knife's edge. Choices include a knife magnet, knife block, drawer insets, and also individual knife protectors.

One of the most versatile lunch boxes you'll ever come across, the Ms. Bento lunch jar comes with three different containers that allow you to pack a multi-course lunch of both hot and cold items easily and securely.  The jar itself is made of stainless steel and is vacuum-insulated that houses three plastic containers with lids. The large soup bowl comes with gasket-sealed lid to prevent messy spills and is specially insulated to keep soup hot. All pieces should be washed by hand with non-abrasive cleaning pads. Inner bowls are microwave-safe.  The lunch jar lid also locks to hold all the inner containers. The Ms. Bento also comes with a convenient carry bag with a strap for easy transport. A forked spoon is included with its own protective cover. Capacity: Main Bowl 10oz, Side Bowl 11 oz, Soup Bowl 7 oz. Dimensions: Container measures 10 by 6 by 6 inches. Ms. Bento Features  Vacuum insulation keeps foods hot or cold for hours Durable stainless steel construction with excellent heat retention 3 microwaveable inner bowls Washable nonstick coated outer container Includes forked spoon with cover and easy to carry tote bag BPA Free 5 Year Warranty on Vacuum Insulationy      Great for Hot or Cold Lunches The Ms. Bento is an excellent way to safely and conveniently pack lunch where microwave or refrigerator may not be available. The Ms. Bento allows you to compartmentalize your food and bring an entire meal, like a pasta dish, soup, salad and cookies in each separate bowl. You will appreciate the \u201cgreenness\u201d of packing a lunch in our lunch jars, instead of using a paper bag or disposable containers. How does it keep food hot or cold? With Zojirushi's renowned vacuum insulation technology, air between the two thin layers of stainless steel on the outer container is removed, creating a vacuum. Because there is no air, the temperature on the outside does not transfer into the container; keeping foods hot or cold for hours.         What's in the Box Side Bowl The Ms. Bento comes with an 11-ounce side bowl that sits inside the lid. It is ideal for foods that should be kept room temperature, such as chips, nuts or snacks. The side bowl is not insulated. Main Bowl The 10-ounce main bowl is designed to hold the main course. The outer container's vacuum insulation and the insulated lid of the main bowl help keep foods hot or cold for hours without reheating or refrigeration. Soup Bowl The 7-ounce soup bowl has a unique lid that minimizes leaks and is ideal for holding soups, dips, or fruit cocktail. It sits at the bottom of the outer container, where vacuum insulation keeps the foods hot or cold for hours. Forked Spoon Never worry about forgetting your utensils. The Ms. Bento also includes a forked spoon with its own protective cover.

The hot-forging process forms a strong bond between the pan and its nonstick coating, creating a pan that will stand up to years of use.  Hot-forging manufacturing process ensures pans will never warpAn induction compatible, magnetic stainless steel base ensures superior performance on any cooktopPans are oven-safe up to 500 degrees F (tempered glass lids are oven-safe up to 425 degrees F)Hollow, stay-cool cast stainless steel handles minimize heat transfer and fit comfortably in handSide handles and assist handles feature stainless steel rivets for durabilityNonstick coating is reinforced and safe for dishwashersA convenient side handle hole allows for hanging storage  Each Forged Hard-Anodized (FHA) pan is made from a heavy-gauge forged aluminum with a strong, durable finish that will withstand the demands of everyday use. Each pan absorbs and distributes heat evenly and efficiently, so there are no hot-spots during cooking. The specially-constructed base incorporates a magnetic stainless steel disk that gives extra strength and stability to the pan. Le Creuset FHA is completely multi-functional. Use it with any stovetop or under any broiler, or use in any conventional, induction or fan-assisted oven. As with any metal product, this material is not suitable for use in microwave ovens. Le Creuset's manufacturing process and the pan's internally reinforced nonstick surface combine to create a uniquely durable finish for extra strength and superb cooking results. Heat recommendations Use medium and low heat settings for the majority of cooking on all heat sources, and allow the pan to heat gradually and evenly. When searing meat, poultry or fish, a medium high heat can be used initially, but once the pan is hot and the food added, the heat should be lowered. The pan should never be used on the highest heat setting for either preheating or cooking. Excessive surface temperatures will damage the nonstick cooking surface. See section on details of misuse. Always use a stovetop burner that is similar in size to the base of the pan. Gas flames must always be confined to the base area and never extend up the sidewalls of the pan. On any glass-topped stove always lift the pan to move it. Never slide the pan, as this may cause damage to the stovetop or the base of the pan. The maximum safe temperature for oven use is 500 degrees F / 260 degrees C. When used under a hot broiler there should be a minimum distance of two inches (5cm) between the heat source and the top rim of the pan. Cleaning and care Cool the pan for a few minutes before cleaning. Do not plunge a hot pan into cold water. Only recommended nonstick cleaning pads should be used on the nonstick surfaces. Do not use any metal or abrasive pads or abrasive cleaning agents on any of the surfaces. The pan is dishwasher-safe, but washing by hand is recommended. Simply wash with hot, soapy water, and rinse and dry thoroughly. If the pan is regularly washed in the dishwasher some darkening of the rivets and outer ring of the base may occur, or a powdery white deposit may form. This is normal and will not affect the performance of the pan. The surface dulling or white deposits can be removed by carefully cleaning the affected areas with a gentle nylon pad and detergent. After cleaning, rinse and dry thoroughly. Each time the pan is cleaned in the dishwasher, the cooking surface should be re-conditioned with vegetable or corn oil before the next use. Le Creuset Heat-Resistant Glass Lids Add another dimension to cooking with a Le Creuset Forged Hard-Anodized pan by using a Le Creuset heat-resistant glass lid. The tempered glass lid allows you to check the recipe without disturbing the cooking progress or temperature. It retains moisture and flavor and converts the pan to one for poaching, braising or casseroling. The lids are oven-safe up to 325 degrees F.

Because of the unique design of the patented Converga-Flow system of your NESCO/American Harvest dehydrator, you'll be surprised at how quickly most foods dry. Drying times may vary, depending on the type and amount of food, thickness and evenness of the slices, percentage of water in the food, humidity, temperature of air, altitude.  Adjustable Thermostat (95 degrees to 155 degrees): Allows user to dry different foods at their proper temperatures.  Opaque Vita-Save Exterior:  Helps block harmful light and retain vitamins and minerals.  Drying Temperature Fruits, fruit rolls and vegetables should be dried at 130 degree F to 140 degree F (55 degree C to 60 degree C). By drying foods in this temperature range you will minimize the loss of heat-sensitive vitamins A and C. All foods sweat when they begin to dry, the temperature may be set higher than 140 degree F (60 degree C) during the first couple of hours of drying. The actual temperature of the food will remain 15 degree F to 20 degree F (6o to 8o degree C) lower than the air temperature for the first couple of hours.  Meats and fish should be dried on the highest temperature setting of your dehydrator. These temperatures also keep bacteria and other spoilage micro-organisms, common to meat and fish, to a minimum during the first stages of drying.  Nuts and seeds are high in oil, and if higher temperatures are used, they will tend to become rancid, developing off flavors. The best temperature is from 90 degree F to 100 degree F (30 degree C to 40 degree C).  Herbs and spices are most flavorful when they first open and should be harvested while very fresh, before they begin to blossom. Because the aromatic oils are very sensitive, temperatures should be 90 degree F to 100 degree F (30 degree C to 40 degree C) for drying. Take care not to load trays too heavily as this will prolong the drying time.  Dried flowers, herbs and spices used for potpourri should be dried at temperatures ranging from 90 degree F to 100 degree F (30 degree C to 40 degree C) to maintain aroma and color.  Holds Up To 3 Cups of Liquid or PureeDrying Fruit Rolls Fruit rolls are a favorite snack for young and old alike. It is a chewy fruit product made from pureed fresh fruit canned or frozen, which has been dried and rolled into snack sized pieces. Most fruits can also be combined with others.  Some fruits, such as apples, are high in pectin and fiber, and have an excellent texture when dried. Use fresh fruit in season. You can also use slightly overripe fruits, irregularly shaped fruits, or slightly bruised fruits that would be unsuitable for canning or drying. Some fruits, such as citrus, should be used in combination with other fruits because they have so much liquid and very little pulp.  If you find that a fruit is too runny, combine it with apple, applesauce or a similar fruit that will give it more substance. When fresh fruits are not available, canned or frozen fruits (either sweetened or un-sweetened) can be used. Simply drain the liquid, and pour the fruit into the blender. Applesauce can be taken directly from the container for wonderful fruit rolls.  Drying Jerky Jerky is a favorite snack for school, lunch, on the trail or just about anywhere. It is made by seasoning lean, raw meat in a salt mixture, then drying it without cooking. The finished product is a protein-rich exercise in chewing and ever so delicious.

You can make delicious jerky from ground meat, using the NESCO/American Harvest Jerky WorksTM kit. It's best to use ground round or lean (or extra lean) meat. Season with NESCO/ Harvest Jerky seasoning mixes.  FAQ 1. Q: How dehydration works: A: The process is very simple. Increasing the temperature of food makes its moisture evaporate. Air moving over the food carries the moisture away. Controlling the temperature and air circulation prevents food from spoiling while it is drying. If sufficient water is removed from the food, micro-organisms and enzymes that would make the food spoil are disrupted.  2. Q: How do you know when foods are dry? A: Always let foods cool for a few minutes. Check to see if the food is still moist or sticky. If it is leathery and pliable, it is usually done. However, foods that are over dried may become brittle and turn brown.  3. Q: If I powdered my dried vegetables, what could I use them for? A: Powdered onion and garlic, of course, are great seasonings for meats and sauces. Powdered tomatoes can be reconstituted into tomato sauce, paste, catsup, juice or soup. A blender or food processor will give you the finest texture. Store in air-tight container. Try making our own lemon zest, pepper flakes or corn meal.  Clean-A-Screen for Drying Sticky Foods and Herbs4. Q: Will flavors mix if I dry different foods together in the same dehydrator? A: If you dry foods in the same category, such as fruits with other fruits and vegetables with other vegetables, the flavors should not mix. However, we do not recommend drying onions with any other foods.  5. Q: What are the benefits of food drying? A: There are many benefits of drying food. Here are some:  You are in control of the quality of food you eat.You will save money.You can take advantage of supermarket specials.You can create a tasty snack that is good for you.You can take advantage of your own garden by drying your fruits and vegetables to be used year round.Cheapest way to preserve foods \ufffd costs half as much as canning and seven times cheaper than freezing.Storing dried foods requires 1/10 of the space of canned foods.

Competition There are an abundance of stamped and etched graters available in the market, but not all graters are created equal. Only Cuisipro's graters take etched graters to the next level with a special Surface Glide Technology, exclusive to Cuisipro.  In addition to razor sharp etched blades the Surface Glide Technology creates the perfect balance between ease of grating and maximum efficiency for the ultimate grating experience that etched graters alone cannot compete with.  In addition to the exclusive Cuisipro Surface Glide Technology, the entire line of Cuisipro graters and shavers possess well-applied ergonomics. Features Grate More With Less Effort With Surface Glide Technology:  The science behind Super Glide Technology is based in the repeated grooved pattern that is spread evenly across the face of the grating surface. The grooves provide 2 distinct benefits beyond other graters. First, the groove reduces resistance, making grating effortless. Secondly the groove elongates the length of each individual blade, so it has a larger cutting surface that comes in contact with food, therefore producing more gratings per stroke. Combined these features to create a perfect surface for outstanding uninterrupted grating performance where food glides through blades.  Protective Cover Doubles As A Measuring Tool:  The Rasps and Flat grater collection feature a snap on, clear protective cover with US and metric measurements. Not only does the cover provide safe storage, but is a container to catch grated ingredients for measuring. Very few graters offer protective covers and no other grater in the market provides a cover with the added benefit of measuring or catching the grated ingredient. Secure Grip For Safety:  The entire line of graters feature ergonomic handles with non-slip finish designed to protect your hands while providing the best grip possible for safe grating. Similar rasps graters don't have handles and other graters don't have the same attention to non-slip grip and ergonomic handles.   Non Slip End for Stability:  The Rasps, Flat and Dual graters have non\ufffdslip ends and box grater a non-slip base that keep the graters in place and steady while resting on the cutting board. No chance of grater slipping or sliding around the surface. Majority of graters do not include non-slip ends \ufffd especially for rasps and dual graters.

A quality mill with a specifically designed grinding mechanism will release the aromas and essential oils of that spice. Freshly ground pepper and spices have more aroma and better flavor than pre- ground. Another advantage of using freshly ground spices or minerals (salts) is the control a mill provides for determining the coarseness (size) of a grind. A high quality pepper, salt or spice mill gives you the ability to choose and change the coarseness according to taste or necessity.  How to Choose a Good Mill When looking for a pepper, salt or spice grinder, consider the following: Grinding mechanism: Choose a grinding mechanism that can withstand daily use: one that is well made and produces a consistent grind. Ideally, the grinding mechanism should be designed to handle a specific spice, as each spice has different physical characteristics that will benefit from different design features.  Design and appearance: Whether it's traditional or modern, manual or electric, a mill can be an indispensable tool in your kitchen and a beautiful part of table decor.  Ease of Use: A quality mill should be easy to adjust, easy to fill, and feel comfortable in the hand.  History of Peugeot Peugeot's story starts in the 19th century when the Peugeot brothers converted the family's gristmill into a steel foundry. They began producing award winning hand tools immediately after opening and went on to produce a diverse range of exceptional quality products including small appliances, bicycles and most notably, automobiles. (Although now operating as a separate company, the Peugeot car company continues the same commitment to quality and innovation that is a Peugeot hallmark). In 1840 Peugeot created their burr style coffee grinder and adopted that design to accommodate peppercorns in 1874. The resulting pepper mechanism design is still used today in every Peugeot pepper mill. Peugeot's iconic pepper grinding mechanism design is often copied, but never equaled. Today, Peugeot offers six unique spice-specific mechanisms plus the original burr-style coffee grinder. There are no shortcuts: each mechanism is designed to get the most out of the spices they are intended for. After more than 160 years, Peugeot mills and grinders remain the benchmark of the industry and have earned their position as the mill of choice in world class kitchens. It's All About the Mechanism  The primary difference between Peugeot and all other brands are the spice-specific mechanisms. Peugeot has 7 unique spice specific mechanisms for pepper, salt, herbs and spices, coffee, wet salt, chili peppers and nutmeg. For each spice, there is one - and only one - Peugeot grinding mechanism, each made of the ideal design and constructed from the best material available for its intended use. All Peugeot mechanisms are made in France and carry a lifetime limited warranty.    Peugeot's Pepper Grinding Mechanism is a two stage burr-style system. During production, the helix-shaped grooves and grinding teeth of the pepper mechanism are individually cut before the steel is case hardened to make it virtually indestructible. The mechanism is then given a proprietary treatment to provide additional protection against corrosion. During use, the helix- shaped grooves guide whole peppercorns through the mechanism to crack, then grind to a consistent size by a double row of teeth. This process releases the pepper's essential oils, resulting in more flavor and aroma for your dish. This patented mechanism is found on every Peugeot Pepper mill and is widely considered the best pepper mechanism available      Peugeot's Salt Crushing Mechanism features two ribbed plates which work to fracture and crush coarse, dry sea salt to a consistent size. The salt grinding mechanism is made of corrosion resistant Stainless Steel, and is found on every Peugeot Salt Mill.       Peugeot's Spice Mechanism is made of ceramic, and is specially designed to grind dried spices and flat leafy herbs to release their essential oils. It is particularly effective with dried aromatic herbs such as thyme, parsley, basil, oregano, and herbs de Provence, as well as dried seeds such as cumin.       Peugeot's Chili Pepper Mechanism is made of case hardened steel for optimal hardness and resilience. This patented mechanism features a pre-cutting system and dual chamber reservoir. For use with dry, hot chilis such as birds tongue, African devils and Piri Piri.     The Nutmeg Shaving Mechanism is made of treated stainless steel which is corrosion resistant, and offers superior edge retention. The Peugeot nutmeg shaver is equipped with a double stainless steel grater blade and a strong claw which enables the whole nutmeg to be very finely shaved, while keeping fingers safe. Intended for use with whole nutmeg nuts.       Peugeot's Wet Salt mechanism has been specially designed for wet sea salt: a spiral guides the salt, ensuring that it does not stick together. The mechanism is made of ceramic because wet salt crystals are soft (wear is not an issue) but corrosive. Intended for use with damp sea salts such as Sel de Guerande.       The Coffee Grinding Mechanism found in all Peugeot coffee mills is the foundation of Peugeot's grinding legacy. The case-hardened steel mechanism efficiently cracks and grinds coffee beans to the desired consistency:from espresso fine to coffee- press coarse.          Peugeot Manual Mills For best results, hold mill and turn mill top in a clockwise direction only To adjust the Grind on manual mills not equipped with u'Select, turn the adjustment nut located on the top of the mill.  - clockwise to obtain a finer grind  - counter-clockwise to obtain a coarser grind          Peugeot Electric Mill  Electric mills permit single-handed use, leaving you free to cook at the same time. Just press the button to start grinding.  Classic Electric Pepper Mills To adjust the grind on an electric mill, turn the thumbwheel grind adjustment (found below the grinding mechanism on electric mills that are not equipped with the u'Select system). - Clockwise to obtain a finer grind, - Counter-clockwise to obtain a coarser grind.   Classic Electric Salt Mills Classic Electric Salt Mills (not fitted with the u'Select grind adjustment system) are pre-set to medium and cannot be adjusted.

In one minute, the aeropress will make 1 to 4 cups of american or espresso style coffee. Coffee brewed in an aeropress is rich but smooth for good technical reasons. The first and most important reason is brewing speed. Coffee yields its rich flavors quickly. From when you add hot water to when you are ready to drink, the aeropress takes about 30 seconds, just like a fine espresso machine. The time required to fill a drip coffee maker pot or the steeping time required for a traditional coffee press is measured in minutes, not seconds, and because of that, they brew bitter, acidic coffee. When brewing coffee with an aeropress, you use very hot but not boiling water, you use finely ground coffee, and the filter prevents any grit from getting into your cup, all of which are additional important reasons aeropress brewed coffee is so remarkably delicious. Fast and convenient, the aeropress coffee and espresso maker makes one of the best cups of coffee you'll ever taste. This innovative uses the ideal water temperature and gentle air pressure brewing to produce coffee and espresso that has rich flavor with lower acidity and without bitterness. It makes 1 to 4 cups of coffee or espresso, enough for 1 or 2 mugs, features a micro filtered for grit free coffee, and takes just 1 minute to make coffee, actual press time takes only 20 seconds. Its aeropress time. Fast and convenient, the AeroPress Coffee and Espresso Maker makes one of the best cups of coffee you'll ever taste. This innovative uses the ideal water temperature and gentle air pressure brewing to produce coffee and espresso that has rich flavor with lower acidity and without bitterness. It makes 1 to 4 cups of coffee or espresso (enough for 1 or 2 mugs), features a micro filtered for grit free coffee, and takes just 1 minute to make coffee (actualpress time takes only 20 seconds).   With total immersion brewing, the AeroPress produces uniform extraction for the ultimate in full coffee flavor.      To brew a double espresso or 10-ounce cup of coffee:  Place a microfilter in the bottom cap of the AeroPress chamber and twist the cap tightly closed. Place two scoops of ground coffee from the included AeroPress scoop into the chamber. Stand the chamber on a sturdy mug, then proceed to pour hot water into the top of the chamber (175 degrees F is optimal). Stir the water and coffee with the included paddle for about 10 seconds. Insert the plunger into the chamber and gently press down about a quarter of an inch and continue to maintain that pressure for 20 to 30 seconds (gentle pressure is the key to easy AeroPressing).  This will result in a double espresso. To make an Americano, simply top off the mug with hot water, or add hot milk for a creamy latte. The AeroPress can press from 1 to 4 scoops, and each scoop from the included AeroPress scoop makes the equivalent of a single espresso or 5 ounces of American coffee. Fill the chamber with hot water to the number corresponding to the number of scoops.  You can also make a full carafe of coffee using the AeroPress in less time than it takes to brew a pot of drip coffee. Two 3-scoop or 4-scoop pressing, topped off with hot water, will fill most vacuum carafes.  The AeroPress is the result of several years of applied research by inventor/engineer Alan Adler, who conducted numerous brewing experiments, measuring the brew with laboratory instruments. The experiments demonstrated that proper temperature, total immersion and rapid filtering were key to flavor excellence. He then designed and tested dozens of brewers before settling on the AeroPress design. Adler's best-known invention is the Aerobie flying ring which set the Guinness World record for the world's farthest throw (1,333 feet). Comparison of Brewing Methods Drip Brewing Traditional drip brewing passes water through a bed of grounds. When the water first drips into the bed, it is too hot and bitterness is extracted. As the water filters downward through the bed, it becomes too cool and extraction is weak. The water doesn't contact all of the grounds uniformly. Grounds at the edge of the bed are under-extracted, while grounds at the center are over- extracted and contribute bitterness.  Total immersion of the grounds in the AeroPress completely solves these problems. All of the grounds contact the same water temperature, and the brewing process is short and sweet. The gentle air pressure of the AeroPress also extracts extra flavor from the coffee. Ordinary drip brewers leave a lot of flavor in their soggy grounds.  The drip method cannot make a robust single cup because the small amount of water doesn't heat the bed enough for rich extraction. It is also slow. AeroPress makes one to four servings with a single pressing in less than a minute. The flavor is equally rich for any number of cups.  Espresso Machines Most coffee lovers agree that espresso is less bitter than drip brew because of the shorter brewing time. However when we ran comparison taste-tests in the homes of espresso lovers, they all agreed that AeroPress espresso tasted better than the brew from their high-priced European espresso machines--why? The reason is that the total immersion brewing of the AeroPress yields a robust flavor at lower temperature--and lower temperature brew is far less bitter. Home espresso machines don\u2019t allow adjustment of temperature. But even if they did, their lack of total immersion would not yield robust flavor at reduced temperature. In addition to smoother taste, the AeroPress has several other advantages over conventional espresso machines.  Grind is not critical in the AeroPress. Grind is so critical in espresso machines that most grinders cannot produce a grind fine enough to make a good tasting shot! Special espresso grinders cost hundreds of dollars and require frequent cleaning.  Espresso experts always adjust the grind when there are changes in humidity or batches of coffee. They throw away two or three shots while adjusting the grind in to achieve the desired 25-second shot.  There is no tamping in the AeroPress. Books on espresso teach the art of just the right amount of tamping. They instruct the home barista to practice on the bathroom scale to learn exactly thirty pounds of pressure.  There is no pre-warming of the portafilter head. In fact the AeroPress has no portafilter head!  There is no maintenance. Espresso machines require regular cleaning and descaling with caustic chemicals. They also require disassembly and cleaning of the showerhead.  There is no need to judge when to stop the pull. This is the most critical skill in using an espresso machine. As espresso lovers well know, most would-be baristas in coffee shops, hotels and restaurants run the pump too long--extracting sour bitterness from the grounds.  With the AeroPress, the amount of water is predetermined by the user, who can brew any strength from weak to super-intense just by choosing the desired amount of water prior to pressing.   Pod Brewers Many single-cup pod brewers have come to market recently. Some of these machines make American coffee. Others make espresso. They range in price from about $60 to several hundred dollars. A highly respected product review magazine tested the three most popular pod brewers and reported the flavor as \"mediocre at best.\"  French Presses People see some similarities between the AeroPress and a French Press. Both use total immersion and pressure. But the similarities end there.  The filter in the French Press is at the top of the mixture. Because coffee floats, the floating grounds clog the filter and makes pressing and cleaning very difficult. Users are instructed to use only coarse ground coffee. But this reduces the amount of flavor that can be extracted from the coffee and necessitates long steeping times which extract bitterness.  Furthermore, even coarse ground coffee includes many fine particles. These small particles pass through and around the filter resulting in a bitter, gritty brew. The particles in the brew continue to leach out bitterness. Consequently French press users are advised to drink or decant the brew immediately. Also, some particles clog the filter screen making pressing and cleaning very difficult.  AeroPress coffee is micro-filtered. It so pure and particle-free that it can be stored for days as a concentrate. The concentrate can be drunk as espresso, mixed with milk for lattes, or diluted to make American coffee. French presses cannot make espresso or lattes. Finally, cleaning the French press is quite a chore. The AeroPress chamber is self-cleaning. A ten-second rinse of the plunger is all that's required.", "salesrank_2018": "2319"}, "B0018RYBW2": {"description": "Tear at leafy greens no more!

The 6.5\u201d Ceramic Chef\u2019s Knife is the most versatile of knives. It is referred to as the \u201cKing\u201d of the kitchen. The chef\u2019s knife is the most popular knife type in the household and is considered a multi-purpose knife. It is ideal for mincing, slicing and chopping such things as: -Fruits and vegetables -Larger cuts of tender meats and fish THE CERAMIC ADVANTAGE Imagine paper thin tomato slices or perfectly diced onions, Shenzhen Ceramic Knives give you precision slicing every time due to ceramic\u2019s special material properties. The blade is made of an advanced ceramic called zirconium oxide that is much harder than steel, and second in hardness to only diamond. Ceramic blanks are produced by dry pressing zirconia powder and subjecting the blanks through an advanced heating process called, sintering. The ceramic blanks are then sharpened and honed to a razor sharp edge and attached to the knife handle. This results in an extremely hard blade that maintains its edge approximately 10-15 times longer than steel knives. That means your ceramic knives can be used longer without resharpening. Ceramic is also non-reactive, which means ceramic knives will not rust and are easy to clean. Because of their resistance to strong oils and acids, they won\u2019t absorb flavors or odors from foods; which won\u2019t leave any after-taste residue on foods that you slice. It also keeps fruit and vegetables from browning as quickly. STEEL KNIVES VS CERAMIC KNIVES Unlike ceramic blades, steel blades are porous, and they can sometimes leave behind an after-taste or residue on the food you\u2019re cutting. And due to its softer material, steel blades lose their edge much quicker than a ceramic blade, and they need to be re-sharpened often. Properly cleaning steel knives to prevent rust is a must as well, as they will corrode eventually, unlike ceramic knives. Because you can\u2019t use ceramic knives to chop or cut through bones, cheeses and other hard foods, ceramic knives will never fully replace the steel knife in the kitchen. You will still need to use your steel knife for heavy duty cutting, but Shenzhen Knives are a perfect complement to your steel knives for slicing fruits and vegetables and other precision cutting tasks. THE SHENZHEN KNIVES ADVANTAGE Shenzhen Knives is the leading online brand of ceramic knives. As a result of our e-commerce only sales model, we can make high performance ceramic technology available to everyone. Even though ceramic knives were first introduced over 25 years ago, the price has not changed much, even with improvements in ceramic technology and manufacturing. We soon realized that there were so many layers of marketing and distribution. At Shenzhen Knives we do not spend millions on celebrity chef\u2019s endorsements, and avoid brick and mortar retailers who need to add their huge markup to cover their overhead. We felt that such a great product \u2013that doesn\u2019t need to be sharpened as often as a steel knife, and knowing the blade won\u2019t rust \u2013 should be in everyone's kitchen. CARING FOR YOUR CERAMIC KNIFE Ceramic knives are for slicing purposes only and should not be used for any other purpose. Never \"force\" the cut; if it does not slice easily and you need to press down hard on the knife to cut your food, the knife blade can snap. Please do not do the following: CUT BONES: Never use your ceramic knife to pry or cut into bones as this may cause the ceramic blade to chip, or the tip to snap off. CUT FROZEN OR HARD FOODS: Do not use on frozen foods or hard foods (such as cheeses, carrots, melons, etc.) STRIKE HARD SURFACES: Do not strike hard surfaces with the ceramic blade (either sideways to crush garlic or blade-down to chop bones) or drop the knife on the floor as the blade may break. SHARPENING YOUR CERAMIC KNIFE If properly cared for, ceramic knives can go years without re-sharpening. However eventually the ceramic blade will develop micro nicks that will make the blade feel dull, and can be re-sharpened using a diamond sharpening wheel. Our Shenzhen Knives electric 2-stage electric diamond knife sharpener is perfect for sharpening both your ceramic and steel knives.

At Shenzhen Knives we do not spend millions on celebrity chef\u2019s endorsements, and avoid brick and mortar retailers who need to add their huge markup to cover their overhead. We felt that such a great product \u2013that doesn\u2019t need to be sharpened as often as a steel knife, and knowing the blade won\u2019t rust \u2013 should be in everyone's kitchen. CARING FOR YOUR CERAMIC KNIFE Ceramic knives are for slicing purposes only and should not be used for any other purpose. Never \"force\" the cut; if it does not slice easily and you need to press down hard on the knife to cut your food, the knife blade can snap. Please do not do the following: CUT BONES: Never use your ceramic knife to pry or cut into bones as this may cause the ceramic blade to chip, or the tip to snap off. CUT FROZEN OR HARD FOODS: Do not use on frozen foods or hard foods (such as cheeses, carrots, melons, etc.) STRIKE HARD SURFACES: Do not strike hard surfaces with the ceramic blade (either sideways to crush garlic or blade-down to chop bones) or drop the knife on the floor as the blade may break. SHARPENING YOUR CERAMIC KNIFE If properly cared for, ceramic knives can go years without re-sharpening. However eventually the ceramic blade will develop micro nicks that will make the blade feel dull, and can be re-sharpened using a diamond sharpening wheel. Our Shenzhen Knives electric 2-stage electric diamond knife sharpener is perfect for sharpening both your ceramic and steel knives.  OUR PROMISE TO TREAT CUSTOMERS FAIRLY At Shenzhen Knives, we do not have a 100-page customer service policy handbook. Instead, we live by the simple motto of \u201ctreat customers how you would like to be treated\u201d. And that is the mandate that guides our interaction with customers. And while most companies don\u2019t want to point out their mistakes, we invite you to look at some of our negative reviews and see how our customer support measures up to other companies. It\u2019s our belief that customer support doesn\u2019t mean much when you like the product or the product works perfectly. It\u2019s only important when something goes wrong, and the measure of a good company is how they react to dissatisfied customers or mistakes. And while we strive to have 0% defective rates on our knives and 100% satisfaction, we realize that mistakes do happen from time to time, and when that happens, please let us know. SPREAD THE WORD! Please write a product review to let others know about our product. As a business with a limited ad budget, word-of-mouth marketing is our life blood and our company relies heavily on them.

If you wish to enhance the flavor and appearance of foods, you need add only a minimum amount to the nonstick surface of your cookware. Energy-Efficient Cooking: Select a burner size that matches the diameter of the bottom of the pan. When cooking over a gas burner, make certain that the flame touches only the bottom of the pan. If the flame extends up the sides of the pan, energy is wasted.  Easy Maintenance: Let your Cuisinart GreenGourmet Cookware cool before cleaning. Cookware should be washed by hand with hot sudsy water and a sponge or soft dishcloth. Do not use steel wool or other metal or abrasive pads that can scratch your cookware. After washing, rinse thoroughly and dry immediately.  Cleaning the Exterior: Cuisinart GreenGourmet Cookware has a smooth exterior finish, making it easier to clean and maintain. Food residue or buildup on the exterior of your cookware can easily be removed with hot soapy water and a scrub pad. The exterior of Cuisinart Cookware, like other brands, will show wear with continuous use. This condition will not in any way affect the superior cooking performance of your cookware.

The exterior of Cuisinart Cookware, like other brands, will show wear with continuous use. This condition will not in any way affect the superior cooking performance of your cookware.  Proper Cooking Utensils We recommend using plastic or wooden utensils in your Cuisinart GreenGourmet Cookware to maintain its appearance and performance. Refrain from cutting foods or using sharp utensils such as forks, knives, mashers or whisks that can scratch the cooking surface. Slight surface marks and abrasions are normal and will not affect the performance of the Cuisinart Ceramica coating. Durable Cookware for a Lifetime of Great Meals With a little bit of care, you\u2019ll enjoy a great performance from your Cuisinart GreenGourmet cookware for years to come. A careful hand washing after each use is usually all it takes. But if pans become crusty or heavily greased, a couple of hours soaking in hot sudsy water and a light scrub will have them looking like new. Seasoning your pans twice a year helps to maintain optimal performance, and it\u2019s easy! Just add a half-tablespoon of vegetable oil and spread it around the entire interior, right up to the rim. Then place the pan in a preheated 300\u00b0F oven for an hour. Carefully remove the pan, allow it to cool completely, and wipe off any excess oil with a paper towel. Be gentle with your cookware! Avoid stacking, which may cause chipping of the ceramic interior. Show it off on a Cuisinart cookware rack, or store it carefully, with a little breathing room, in your kitchen cabinets.

Cousin Liana\u2019s rustic pasta maker brings old world charm and function to contemporary kitchen tools. Special ridges on the board form a more consistent shape than would using a fork, and add the traditional texture that holds more sauce without flattening the delicate dough. Similarly sized gnocchi cook more evenly and allow for a more attractive presentation. The easy-grip handle helps achieve, and maintain, the perfect angle and keeps it steady during use. Simple to use. Prepare dough according to the desired gnocchi recipe. Roll dough into long ropes, \u00be-inch in diameter, then cut into individual squares, \u00be-inch long. For best results, working each piece separately, place a square of dough onto the Gnocchi Board and press slightly to imprint it. Then, starting at the top of the pasta, roll it along the ridges with a gentle pressure to imprint the entire circumference. Dust the gnocchi with flour to prevent them from sticking and set aside until all dough is formed. Cousin Liana\u2019s Gnocchi Board works nicely as a cavatelli maker, too!

The tapered knife edge is ground in two directions to hold its edge longer, and can easily be brought back to original sharpness.  Types of Boning Knives Stiff Blade Meant for tougher meats.

In 2011 Victorinox began marketing all its product lines, including kitchen knives, under the common umbrella name by which the company is now popularly known; Victorinox Swiss Army.

Following these simple guidelines will ensure that you get the longest life out of your knife!   Hand Washing Victorinox Swiss Army recommends washing all knives by hand. For best results, hand wash your knives with a soapy cloth and dry immediately.   Dishwasher While Fibrox Pro knives are dishwasher safe, we recommend hand washing as dishwashers are designed to spray water at a relatively high pressure, which can jostle the silverware and cause the knives to collide, dulling the edge.   Maintaining your Knife's Edge  For optimum performance, knives should be honed after every couple of uses. Proper and frequent use of a honing steel will keep your knives sharper and performing at their best, but remember that a honing steel will not sharpen a dull knife. Honing steels are maintenance tools and are used to help keep an already sharp blade from degrading. During use, a knife edge becomes rolled or turned from direct contact with cutting boards, bones or other hard objects. In this case, honing is necessary to straighten the edge of the knife. After significant use, the steel particles become damaged and the edge cannot be brought back by honing, so sharpening is necessary. If your knives are dull, pitted, or you see visible nicks on the cutting edge, you'll need to sharpen with a Swiss Sharp Handheld Sharpener (49002) or bring to a professional for re-sharpening.   History and Heritage In 1884, Master Cutler Karl Elsener opened a cutlery shop in Ibach, Switzerland. There, he and the cutler's; union he formed produced the finest steel cutlery, finished with the now-famous proprietary edge preferred globally by professional and home cooks.

Although Victorinox is known the world over as the creator of the Original Swiss Army Knife, the company started out in 1884 as a cutlery workshop. By the time company creator Karl Elsener delivered his first pocket knife to the Swiss Army, his cutlery business was already booming. Over the next century, Victorinox cutlery became a top-rated choice among professionals worldwide, with over 300 blades to offer.  Victorinox knives have regularly appeared as highly ranked and recommended kitchen tools in Cook's Illustrated, Men's Health, The Cincinnati Enquirer, New York Magazine, and Natural Health, just to name a few. In 2009, the company announced a partnership with professional chef, Daniel Humm, of Eleven Madison Park in New York City. In addition, building on the success of its cutlery business, Victorinox has brought all the same quality and expertise to a wider range of products and accessories, including other kitchen tools, pocket tools, watches, luggage, and clothing. Who is R.H. Forschner? Victorinox had been a staple in European commercial cutlery for over 50 years when approached by New York's R.H. Forschner, known since 1855 as a builder of scales for butchers, to be their sole cutlery supplier. The two companies joined forces in 1937, and R.H. Forschner subsequently became North America's dominant professional brand, as ubiquitous in the bustling meatpacking plants of the Midwest as it is in the gleaming, four-star restaurant kitchens of Midtown Manhattan.  As a division of Victorinox/Swiss Army Brands, R.H. Forschner marketed cutlery under the brand name \"RH Forschner by Victorinox\" and distributed to the commercial, food service, and retail trade classes. That brand has been considered a top choice of professionals worldwide with over 300 styles of blades bearing the R.H. Forschner name. However, in 2009, in conjunction with Victorinox's 125th anniversary, the company, Victorinox Swiss Army, Inc., has decided to remove the \"RH Forschner\" name from all blades. Blades thenceforth only include the \"Victorinox\" name.  What is a stamped blade? A stamped knife can usually be identified by the absence of a bolster. Stamped blades are cut into their shapes from cold-rolled pieces of steel and then ground, tempered, and sharpened. Creating them requires many less steps than forging and results in lighter, narrower blades. Some professionals prefer the thicker, heavier forged blades, but many pros, who spend much of their day cutting and slicing, enjoy a lighter knife since it's less fatiguing and easier to manipulate at speed.  Stamped knives are easier to produce and therefore less expensive. They perform very well and can approach the quality of a forged blade, but not the weight or feel. Victorinox manufactures a complete range of stamped blades with unique, patented Fibrox handles and they are considered among the greatest values in the knife industry.  What knives do I need to own? Knife choice or selection is determined by many factors--size, function, style, and preference. The most important factor is function. Different knives have different uses. It is important to use the proper knife for a specific task, since proper knife selection and the use of a proper-sized, sharp knife make for safe cutting. General kitchen tasks and the knife to use for them are as follows:  Paring: The most common to own and use, a paring knife is generally for small cutting jobs and peeling of vegetables or fruit. The blade size is usually from three to four inches. Choose the shape and size to fit your hand. Since this is one of the more versatile knives, owning more than one is recommended. Chef's: The most important tool and essential to every cook, a chef's knife is most often used in a rocking method to mince, dice, and chop vegetables and herbs. This one is known as the chef's best friend. Slicer: Most commonly used to slice meats, poultry, and seafood, the slicer is an important companion to any host or hostess. Boning: As its name suggests, a boning knife is used to trim or remove meat and fish from the bone. Bread: Designed with a special edge, a bread knife makes easy work of cutting through crusty bread, pastries, or any item with a crust and a soft interior. Fillet: Most often used by pros and seasoned home chefs, the fillet knife is used to fillet meat and fish. Cleaver: An important addition to any collection, a cleaver is often used to cut or chop through bones. Santoku: This knife combines the features of a cleaver with a chef's knife. The curved blade helps the rocking motion used for chopping, and the wide blade works well for scooping sliced food off a cutting board and for crushing garlic. The santoku can also be used to slice meat and has a narrow spine for making thin cuts. Utility: An all-purpose knife often referred to as a sandwich knife, the utility knife peels and slices fruits and vegetables, and even carves small meats. Shaping: With its curved blade, a shaping knife is great for small precision cuts where control is essential, such as peeling, trimming, or garnishing.  What are the different knife edges and what do they do? Straight: The vast majority of Victorinox knives come with a straight or fine edge. This means it has a perfect taper along the blade and no serrations. It is designed to cut without tearing or shredding. Serrated: An edge designed with small, jagged teeth along the edge. Scalloped: A blade with waves along the edge generally used to cut breads with a hard crust and soft interior, as well as tougher-skinned fruits and vegetables. Granton: This edge has hollowed-out grooves or dimples on the sides of the blade. These grooves fill with the fat and juices of the product being cut, allowing for thin, even cuts without tearing. Even with the grooves, these are still straight-edge knives and can be honed with a sharpening steel.  How should I care for my cutlery?  After use, knives should not be allowed to soak in water. The best practice is to hand wash and dry them immediately. This is especially true if they have been used on fruit or salty foods, which may cause some staining, even on stainless steel. Most knives require very little maintenance and it is worth the effort to protect your investment.  Though Victorinox knives are dishwasher safe, this is strongly discouraged. The dishwasher's agitation may cause damage. Additionally, harsh detergents can be harmful and cause pitting and spotting on the blades. The handles may also discolor and develop a white film with constant use of the dishwasher. Plus, intense heat associated with dishwashers is not good for the temper of the blade.  How do I keep my knives sharp? All quality knives require proper maintenance to keep them in perfect cutting shape. The best of edges will quickly dull if it strikes metal, glass, or Formica. A wooden cutting board makes the best cutting surface. And, if a slip occurs, a proper cutting board is safer for the user. Frequent use of a Victorinox sharpening steel will keep blades in tip top working condition. All straight-edge knives need steeling to keep their edges. How to \"Steel\" a Knife Steeling a Knife Hold the steel firmly in your left hand with the guard positioned to stop the blade should it slip.Hold the knife in your right hand and place on top part of steel as shown.Raise back of blade one-eighth inch.Now, moving the blade only, draw it across the steel in an arching curve, pivoted at your wrist. The blade tip should leave the steel about two-thirds of the way down.Repeat the same action with the Blade on the bottom side of the steel. Always maintain the same pressure and angle on both sides of the steel.Repeat five or six times.  How should I store my knives?  Safety is the biggest concern of storage, both to the user and to protect the knife's edge. Choices include a knife magnet, knife block, drawer insets, and also individual knife protectors.

Each blade from the stamped line of cutlery is expertly made in Switzerland from high-carbon stainless steel and undergoes a special tempering process for an edge that can be resharpened again and again. The result is a knife that can keep its original sharpness throughout the entire life of the blade. Each blade is conical ground throughout its length and depth, which results in a wider break point with less risk of the blade breaking and less resistance for easier cutting, and then laser tested to ensure optimum cutting power and durability. The blades are paired with classic, beautiful rosewood handles riveted for durability and designed to minimize wrist tension while offering a comfortable grip. The Victorinox stamped collection with rosewood handles is an extensive range with open-stock pieces as well as handy and versatile sets.  This bread knife features a wavy-edge blade. A specialty knife with a wide variety of uses, its scalloped-edge teeth can cut through harder crusts or peel without squashing tender insides. The specially designed wavy edge provides 40 percent more cutting edge in contact with the product than with a traditional plain-edge knife. The edge requires no sharpening, so is ideal for fast-food outlets, busy canteens, and restaurants. All high-quality cutlery and kitchen tools should be washed by hand for best care, and Victorinox covers each piece with a lifetime warranty against manufacturer defects.

Frequent use of a Victorinox sharpening steel will keep blades in tip top working condition. All straight-edge knives need steeling to keep their edges.   How to \"Steel\" a Knife 1. Hold the steel firmly in your left hand with the guard positioned to stop the blade should it slip. 2. Hold the knife in your right hand and place on top part of steel as shown. 3. Raise back of blade one-eighth inch. 4. Now, moving the blade only, draw it across the steel in an arching curve, pivoted at your wrist. The blade tip should leave the steel about two-thirds of the way down. 5. Repeat the same action with the Blade on the bottom side of the steel. Always maintain the same pressure and angle on both sides of the steel. 6. Repeat five or six times.  When a sharpening steel no longer does the job, it\u2019s time to take the knife to a qualified knife sharpener who will place a new edge on it. This, along with use of the sharpening steel, will give you many years of sharp, safe blades.  Please note that electric knife sharpeners can be harmful. They have to be used carefully as they remove too much metal, can harm the temper of the blade, and most important can change the factory-applied edge angle.  How should I store my knives?  Safety is the biggest concern of storage, both to the user and to protect the knife's edge. Choices include a knife magnet, knife block, drawer insets, and also individual knife protectors.", "salesrank_2018": "55032"}, "B0019WXEO2": {"description": " Victorinox Swiss Army Cutlery Who is Victorinox?   Although Victorinox is known the world over as the creator of the Original Swiss Army Knife, the company started out in 1884 as a cutlery workshop. By the time company creator Karl Elsener delivered his first pocket knife to the Swiss Army, his cutlery business was already booming. Over the next century, Victorinox cutlery became a top-rated choice among professionals worldwide, with over 300 blades to offer.  Victorinox knives have regularly appeared as highly ranked and recommended kitchen tools in Cook's Illustrated, Men's Health, The Cincinnati Enquirer, New York Magazine, and Natural Health, just to name a few. In 2009, the company announced a partnership with professional chef, Daniel Humm, of Eleven Madison Park in New York City. In addition, building on the success of its cutlery business, Victorinox has brought all the same quality and expertise to a wider range of products and accessories, including other kitchen tools, pocket tools, watches, luggage, and clothing. Who is R.H. Forschner? Victorinox had been a staple in European commercial cutlery for over 50 years when approached by New York's R.H. Forschner, known since 1855 as a builder of scales for butchers, to be their sole cutlery supplier. The two companies joined forces in 1937, and R.H. Forschner subsequently became North America's dominant professional brand, as ubiquitous in the bustling meatpacking plants of the Midwest as it is in the gleaming, four-star restaurant kitchens of Midtown Manhattan.  As a division of Victorinox/Swiss Army Brands, R.H. Forschner marketed cutlery under the brand name \"RH Forschner by Victorinox\" and distributed to the commercial, food service, and retail trade classes. That brand has been considered a top choice of professionals worldwide with over 300 styles of blades bearing the R.H. Forschner name. However, in 2009, in conjunction with Victorinox's 125th anniversary, the company, Victorinox Swiss Army, Inc., has decided to remove the \"RH Forschner\" name from all blades. Blades thenceforth only include the \"Victorinox\" name.  What is a stamped blade? A stamped knife can usually be identified by the absence of a bolster. Stamped blades are cut into their shapes from cold-rolled pieces of steel and then ground, tempered, and sharpened. Creating them requires many less steps than forging and results in lighter, narrower blades. Some professionals prefer the thicker, heavier forged blades, but many pros, who spend much of their day cutting and slicing, enjoy a lighter knife since it's less fatiguing and easier to manipulate at speed.  Stamped knives are easier to produce and therefore less expensive. They perform very well and can approach the quality of a forged blade, but not the weight or feel. Victorinox manufactures a complete range of stamped blades with unique, patented Fibrox handles and they are considered among the greatest values in the knife industry.  What knives do I need to own? Knife choice or selection is determined by many factors--size, function, style, and preference. The most important factor is function. Different knives have different uses. It is important to use the proper knife for a specific task, since proper knife selection and the use of a proper-sized, sharp knife make for safe cutting. General kitchen tasks and the knife to use for them are as follows:  Paring: The most common to own and use, a paring knife is generally for small cutting jobs and peeling of vegetables or fruit. The blade size is usually from three to four inches. Choose the shape and size to fit your hand. Since this is one of the more versatile knives, owning more than one is recommended. Chef's: The most important tool and essential to every cook, a chef's knife is most often used in a rocking method to mince, dice, and chop vegetables and herbs. This one is known as the chef's best friend. Slicer: Most commonly used to slice meats, poultry, and seafood, the slicer is an important companion to any host or hostess. Boning: As its name suggests, a boning knife is used to trim or remove meat and fish from the bone. Bread: Designed with a special edge, a bread knife makes easy work of cutting through crusty bread, pastries, or any item with a crust and a soft interior. Fillet: Most often used by pros and seasoned home chefs, the fillet knife is used to fillet meat and fish. Cleaver: An important addition to any collection, a cleaver is often used to cut or chop through bones. Santoku: This knife combines the features of a cleaver with a chef's knife. The curved blade helps the rocking motion used for chopping, and the wide blade works well for scooping sliced food off a cutting board and for crushing garlic. The santoku can also be used to slice meat and has a narrow spine for making thin cuts. Utility: An all-purpose knife often referred to as a sandwich knife, the utility knife peels and slices fruits and vegetables, and even carves small meats. Shaping: With its curved blade, a shaping knife is great for small precision cuts where control is essential, such as peeling, trimming, or garnishing.  What are the different knife edges and what do they do? Straight: The vast majority of Victorinox knives come with a straight or fine edge. This means it has a perfect taper along the blade and no serrations. It is designed to cut without tearing or shredding. Serrated: An edge designed with small, jagged teeth along the edge. Scalloped: A blade with waves along the edge generally used to cut breads with a hard crust and soft interior, as well as tougher-skinned fruits and vegetables. Granton: This edge has hollowed-out grooves or dimples on the sides of the blade. These grooves fill with the fat and juices of the product being cut, allowing for thin, even cuts without tearing. Even with the grooves, these are still straight-edge knives and can be honed with a sharpening steel.  How should I care for my cutlery?  After use, knives should not be allowed to soak in water. The best practice is to hand wash and dry them immediately. This is especially true if they have been used on fruit or salty foods, which may cause some staining, even on stainless steel. Most knives require very little maintenance and it is worth the effort to protect your investment.  Though Victorinox knives are dishwasher safe, this is strongly discouraged. The dishwasher's agitation may cause damage. Additionally, harsh detergents can be harmful and cause pitting and spotting on the blades. The handles may also discolor and develop a white film with constant use of the dishwasher. Plus, intense heat associated with dishwashers is not good for the temper of the blade.

Formerly Forschner In 1937 Victorinox began selling cutlery in America through a Connecticut distributor called R.H. Forschner & Co. A well-known manufacturer of butcher scales, Forschner soon became the exclusive U.S. distributor for Victorinox knives, and was the name by which Victorinox knives were known.   In 2011 Victorinox began marketing all its product lines, including kitchen knives, under the common umbrella name by which the company is now popularly known \u2013 Victorinox Swiss Army.   Care and Use Be good to your knives and they\u2019ll be good to you. Following these simple guidelines will ensure that you get the longest life out of your knife!   Hand Washing Victorinox Swiss Army recommends washing all knives by hand. For best results, hand wash your knives with a soapy cloth and dry immediately.   Dishwasher In general, high-quality cutlery should not be run through the dishwasher for the following reasons:  The detergents used are very strong degreasers, especially in the case of wood handles; they can be stripped of their natural oils, causing them to split or crack. Dishwashing machines are designed to spray water at a relatively high pressure, which can jostle the silverware and cause the knives to collide, dulling the edge.   Proper Care for Knives with Rosewood Handles Soaking your knives in water can make the wood swell and possibly crack. It\u2019s best to gently wash the handle with mild soap, rinse and dry. If you notice that the wood seems to be drying out, you can apply a small quantity of mineral oil or beeswax with a paper towel. Let this soak in for 20 minutes and wipe off the excess. This should keep your handles looking good for many, many years.   Maintaining your Knife\u2019s Edge For optimum performance, knives should be honed after every couple of uses. Proper and frequent use of a honing steel will keep your knives sharper and performing at their best, but remember that a honing steel will not sharpen a dull knife. Honing steels are maintenance tools and are used to help keep an already sharp blade from degrading. During use, a knife edge becomes rolled or turned from direct contact with cutting boards, bones or other hard objects. In this case, honing is necessary to straighten the edge of the knife. After significant use, the steel particles become damaged and the edge cannot be brought back by honing, so sharpening is necessary. If your knives are dull, pitted, or you see visible nicks on the cutting edge, you\u2019ll need to sharpen with a Swiss Sharp Handheld Sharpener (49002) or bring to a professional for re-sharpening.   History and Heritage In 1884, Master Cutler Karl Elsener opened a cutlery shop in Ibach, Switzerland. There, he and the cutlers\u2019 union he formed produced the finest steel cutlery, finished with the now-famous proprietary edge preferred globally by professional and home cooks.

Santoku translates to \"three virtues\" or \"three uses\" which refers to the three types of cuts this knife is made for: slicing, dicing, and mincing. It combines features of both a chef's knife and a cleaver. The wide blade is perfect for scooping sliced or chopped ingredients off the cutting board and transferring them into a pot or bowl. The triad of abilities this knife possesses makes it a must-have for every home chef.   Featuring a flat cutting edge and a rounded tip called a sheep's foot, the Rosewood Santoku's unique shape makes it a stand-out from other kitchen knives. The flat edge doesn't rock on the cutting surface, which distinguishes it from a chef's knife, and provides a highly efficient motion for slicing, dicing, and mincing. The Granton blade, also referred to as a hollow or fluted edge, features hollowed-out grooves or dimples on both sides on the blade. Depending on what is being cut, these grooves will fill with juices or create pockets of air, which prevents food from sticking to the blade and creates less friction to allow for easier motion when chopping.   Even with the grooves, these are still straight-edge knives and can be honed with a sharpening steel, so they can remain razor sharp at all times. The tapered knife edge is ground in two directions to hold a sharp edge longer, and can easily be brought back to its original sharpness.

Forschner subsequently became North America's dominant professional brand, as ubiquitous in the bustling meatpacking plants of the Midwest as it is in the gleaming, four-star restaurant kitchens of Midtown Manhattan.  As a division of Victorinox/Swiss Army Brands, R.H. Forschner marketed cutlery under the brand name \"RH Forschner by Victorinox\" and distributed to the commercial, food service, and retail trade classes. That brand has been considered a top choice of professionals worldwide with over 300 styles of blades bearing the R.H. Forschner name. However, in 2009, in conjunction with Victorinox's 125th anniversary, the company, Victorinox Swiss Army, Inc., has decided to remove the \"RH Forschner\" name from all blades. Blades thenceforth only include the \"Victorinox\" name.  What is a stamped blade? A stamped knife can usually be identified by the absence of a bolster. Stamped blades are cut into their shapes from cold-rolled pieces of steel and then ground, tempered, and sharpened. Creating them requires many less steps than forging and results in lighter, narrower blades. Some professionals prefer the thicker, heavier forged blades, but many pros, who spend much of their day cutting and slicing, enjoy a lighter knife since it's less fatiguing and easier to manipulate at speed.  Stamped knives are easier to produce and therefore less expensive. They perform very well and can approach the quality of a forged blade, but not the weight or feel. Victorinox manufactures a complete range of stamped blades with unique, patented Fibrox handles and they are considered among the greatest values in the knife industry.  What knives do I need to own? Knife choice or selection is determined by many factors--size, function, style, and preference. The most important factor is function. Different knives have different uses. It is important to use the proper knife for a specific task, since proper knife selection and the use of a proper-sized, sharp knife make for safe cutting. General kitchen tasks and the knife to use for them are as follows:  Paring: The most common to own and use, a paring knife is generally for small cutting jobs and peeling of vegetables or fruit. The blade size is usually from three to four inches. Choose the shape and size to fit your hand. Since this is one of the more versatile knives, owning more than one is recommended. Chef's: The most important tool and essential to every cook, a chef's knife is most often used in a rocking method to mince, dice, and chop vegetables and herbs. This one is known as the chef's best friend. Slicer: Most commonly used to slice meats, poultry, and seafood, the slicer is an important companion to any host or hostess. Boning: As its name suggests, a boning knife is used to trim or remove meat and fish from the bone. Bread: Designed with a special edge, a bread knife makes easy work of cutting through crusty bread, pastries, or any item with a crust and a soft interior. Fillet: Most often used by pros and seasoned home chefs, the fillet knife is used to fillet meat and fish. Cleaver: An important addition to any collection, a cleaver is often used to cut or chop through bones. Santoku: This knife combines the features of a cleaver with a chef's knife. The curved blade helps the rocking motion used for chopping, and the wide blade works well for scooping sliced food off a cutting board and for crushing garlic. The santoku can also be used to slice meat and has a narrow spine for making thin cuts. Utility: An all-purpose knife often referred to as a sandwich knife, the utility knife peels and slices fruits and vegetables, and even carves small meats. Shaping: With its curved blade, a shaping knife is great for small precision cuts where control is essential, such as peeling, trimming, or garnishing.  What are the different knife edges and what do they do? Straight: The vast majority of Victorinox knives come with a straight or fine edge. This means it has a perfect taper along the blade and no serrations. It is designed to cut without tearing or shredding. Serrated: An edge designed with small, jagged teeth along the edge. Scalloped: A blade with waves along the edge generally used to cut breads with a hard crust and soft interior, as well as tougher-skinned fruits and vegetables. Granton: This edge has hollowed-out grooves or dimples on the sides of the blade. These grooves fill with the fat and juices of the product being cut, allowing for thin, even cuts without tearing. Even with the grooves, these are still straight-edge knives and can be honed with a sharpening steel.  How should I care for my cutlery?  After use, knives should not be allowed to soak in water. The best practice is to hand wash and dry them immediately. This is especially true if they have been used on fruit or salty foods, which may cause some staining, even on stainless steel. Most knives require very little maintenance and it is worth the effort to protect your investment.  Though Victorinox knives are dishwasher safe, this is strongly discouraged. The dishwasher's agitation may cause damage. Additionally, harsh detergents can be harmful and cause pitting and spotting on the blades. The handles may also discolor and develop a white film with constant use of the dishwasher. Plus, intense heat associated with dishwashers is not good for the temper of the blade.  How do I keep my knives sharp? All quality knives require proper maintenance to keep them in perfect cutting shape. The best of edges will quickly dull if it strikes metal, glass, or Formica. A wooden cutting board makes the best cutting surface. And, if a slip occurs, a proper cutting board is safer for the user. Frequent use of a Victorinox sharpening steel will keep blades in tip top working condition. All straight-edge knives need steeling to keep their edges. How to \"Steel\" a Knife Steeling a Knife Hold the steel firmly in your left hand with the guard positioned to stop the blade should it slip.Hold the knife in your right hand and place on top part of steel as shown.Raise back of blade one-eighth inch.Now, moving the blade only, draw it across the steel in an arching curve, pivoted at your wrist. The blade tip should leave the steel about two-thirds of the way down.Repeat the same action with the Blade on the bottom side of the steel. Always maintain the same pressure and angle on both sides of the steel.Repeat five or six times.  How should I store my knives?  Safety is the biggest concern of storage, both to the user and to protect the knife's edge. Choices include a knife magnet, knife block, drawer insets, and also individual knife protectors.

Epicurean brand products are synonymous with proficient and improved food preparation. From dishwasher safe cutting boards to an array of innovative utensils, Epicurean has revolutionized wood kitchenware products. Made of many layers of FSC certified paper pressed together with a food safe resin, all Epicurean products will last for years of daily kitchen use. All products are made in the USA and designed with a focus on function but also with a concern for environmental stewardship. From the heavy duty Big Block boards to the agile Kitchen Series utensils, Epicurean sets a higher standard for every well equipped kitchen.        From Skate Parks to Cutting Boards What do skateboarders and foodies have in common? They're both cutting it up on the same durable material. In 2003 Epicurean was founded by custom skate park manufacturer TrueRide as a way to repurpose excess skating surface material used by the company. The founders of TrueRide knew of the history of the surface material in commercial kitchens, so creating a line of home food prep surfaces from scrap was as natural as, well, skating on it. TrueRide skate parks last for years outdoors with extensive abuse from both weather and skaters, so you can be sure your Epicurean Cutting Surface can handle even the hardest working kitchen.        Eco Initiatives Epicurean understands the relationship between the products we manufacture and the environment we all live in. By purchasing Epicurean products, you are making a consumer statement and showing your commitment to green products and green business practices. Epicurean is dedicated to creating long-lasting products that are manufactured with sustainable manufacturing practices and made from environmentally conscientious materials like recycled paper, plastic, and FSC certified papers. Epicurean's manufacturing facility is founded on principles of efficient and responsible use and reuse of manufacturing materials, and has received multiple awards for its ethical business practices and architectural design. Every year Epicurean employees participate in a Tree Planting Day to help offset the manufacturing process.    Epicurean Wood Fiber Materials Epicurean cutting surfaces are fabricated using materials that gain their natural look and texture from the organic contents that comprise them. Each color is composed of a set of fiber sources layered together and pressed along with a food safe resin to form a sheet that has unequaled food preparation properties. Each color of Epicurean cutting surfaces has slightly different features based on the blend of its sources, though all of them share the fact that they are a wood fiber kitchen tool that is dishwasher safe.       Use and Care All Epicurean cutting surfaces offer a durable design that can stand up to the rigorous daily use of any busy kitchen. They all resist staining and offer maintenance-free convenience--no need to oil or bleach. Though stain-resistant, the cutting surface may stain if left in contact with a highly alkaline product or food for a prolonged amount of time. Liver, papaya, and red beets, for example, may leave a mark. To remove stubborn stains, try a non-abrasive household cleaner. All cutting surfaces can be cleaned in the dishwasher, or by hand in the sink with hot soapy water.       Made In The USA Epicurean cutting boards are exclusively manufactured in the United States of America.       Knife Friendly Cutting on Epicurean cutting boards will not dull your knife so you will sharpen less.       FSC Certified Epicurean's Natural, Slate, and RC100 materials are all certified by the Forest Stewardship Council.       Heat Resistant Epicurean wood fiber cutting boards are heat resistant up to 350\u00b0F / 176\u00b0C, so you can use the surface as a trivet without leaving a blemish. (Not microwave safe; should not be used as cookware.).       NSF Certified Certified by the National Sanitary Foundation, you can be sure that your nonporous Epicurean cutting board will be easy to clean and will not harbor bacteria.

Each blade in the Stamped collection is expertly made in Switzerland from high-carbon stainless steel and undergoes a special tempering process for an edge that can be resharpened again and again. The result is a knife that can keep its original sharpness throughout the entire life of the blade. Each blade is conical ground throughout its length and depth, and laser tested to ensure optimum cutting power and durability. Ergonomically designed to minimize wrist tension, the unique, patented Fibrox handles are slip resistant when wet. Plus, all Stamped cutlery with Fibrox handles is approved by the National Sanitary Foundation (NSF). Although cutlery steel is naturally sanitary, materials and construction details of these handles minimize crevices that may otherwise offer hospitality to bacteria. The Victorinox Stamped collection is an extensive range with open-stock pieces as well as handy and versatile sets.  Often referred to as a chef's best friend, the 8-inch multipurpose chef's knife is designed for chopping, mincing, slicing, and dicing. Sized for comfort, it's also available in 6- and 10-inch versions as well. Made from the same material as the ergonomic black Fibrox, Victorinox's white Handles offer a sanitary view that is necessary for hospital and school kitchens, large food services institutions, and governmental contracts. All Stamped cutlery should be washed by hand for best care, and Victorinox covers each piece with a lifetime warranty against manufacturer defects.  From the Manufacturer   Who is Victorinox? Although Victorinox is known the world over as the creator of the Original Swiss Army Knife, the company started out in 1884 as a cutlery workshop. By the time company creator Karl Elsener delivered his first pocket knife to the Swiss Army, his cutlery business was already booming. Over the next century, Victorinox cutlery became a top-rated choice among professionals worldwide, with over 300 blades to offer.  Victorinox knives have regularly appeared as highly ranked and recommended kitchen tools in Cook\u2019s Illustrated, Men\u2019s Health, The Cincinnati Enquirer, New York Magazine, and Natural Health, just to name a few. In 2009, the company announced a partnership with professional chef, Daniel Humm, of Eleven Madison Park in New York City. In addition, building on the success of its cutlery business, Victorinox has brought all the same quality and expertise to a wider range of products and accessories, including other kitchen tools, pocket tools, watches, luggage, and clothing.  Who is R.H. Forschner? Victorinox had been a staple in European commercial cutlery for over 50 years when approached by New York\u2019s R.H. Forschner, known since 1855 as a builder of scales for butchers, to be their sole cutlery supplier. The two companies joined forces in 1937, and R.H. Forschner subsequently became North America\u2019s dominant professional brand, as ubiquitous in the bustling meatpacking plants of the Midwest as it is in the gleaming, four-star restaurant kitchens of Midtown Manhattan.  As a division of Victorinox/Swiss Army Brands, R.H. Forschner marketed cutlery under the brand name \u201cRH Forschner by Victorinox\u201d and distributed to the commercial, food service, and retail trade classes. That brand has been considered a top choice of professionals worldwide with over 300 styles of blades bearing the R.H. Forschner name. However, in 2009, in conjunction with Victorinox\u2019s 125th anniversary, the company, Victorinox Swiss Army, Inc., has decided to remove the \u201cRH Forschner\u201d name from all blades. Blades thenceforth only include the \u201cVictorinox\u201d name.  What is a stamped blade? A stamped knife can usually be identified by the absence of a bolster. Stamped blades are cut into their shapes from cold-rolled pieces of steel and then ground, tempered, and sharpened. Creating them requires many less steps than forging and results in lighter, narrower blades. Some professionals prefer the thicker, heavier forged blades, but many pros, who spend much of their day cutting and slicing, enjoy a lighter knife since it\u2019s less fatiguing and easier to manipulate at speed.  Stamped knives are easier to produce and therefore less expensive. They perform very well and can approach the quality of a forged blade, but not the weight or feel. Victorinox manufactures a complete range of stamped blades with unique, patented Fibrox handles and they are considered among the greatest values in the knife industry.  What knives do I need to own? Knife choice or selection is determined by many factors--size, function, style, and preference. The most important factor is function. Different knives have different uses. It is important to use the proper knife for a specific task, since proper knife selection and the use of a proper-sized, sharp knife make for safe cutting. General kitchen tasks and the knife to use for them are as follows:  Paring: The most common to own and use, a paring knife is generally for small cutting jobs and peeling of vegetables or fruit. The blade size is usually from three to four inches. Choose the shape and size to fit your hand. Since this is one of the more versatile knives, owning more than one is recommended.  Chef's: The most important tool and essential to every cook, a chef\u2018s knife is most often used in a rocking method to mince, dice, and chop vegetables and herbs. This one is known as the chef\u2019s best friend.  Slicer: Most commonly used to slice meats, poultry, and seafood, the slicer is an important companion to any host or hostess.  Boning: As its name suggests, a boning knife is used to trim or remove meat and fish from the bone.  Bread: Designed with a special edge, a bread knife makes easy work of cutting through crusty bread, pastries, or any item with a crust and a soft interior.  Fillet: Most often used by pros and seasoned home chefs, the fillet knife is used to fillet meat and fish.  Cleaver: An important addition to any collection, a cleaver is often used to cut or chop through bones.  Santoku: This knife combines the features of a cleaver with a chef's knife. The curved blade helps the rocking motion used for chopping, and the wide blade works well for scooping sliced food off a cutting board and for crushing garlic. The santoku can also be used to slice meat and has a narrow spine for making thin cuts.  Utility: An all-purpose knife often referred to as a sandwich knife, the utility knife peels and slices fruits and vegetables, and even carves small meats.  Shaping: With its curved blade, a shaping knife is great for small precision cuts where control is essential, such as peeling, trimming, or garnishing.  What are the different knife edges and what do they do? Straight: The vast majority of Victorinox knives come with a straight or fine edge. This means it has a perfect taper along the blade and no serrations. It is designed to cut without tearing or shredding.  Serrated: An edge designed with small, jagged teeth along the edge.  Scalloped: A blade with waves along the edge generally used to cut breads with a hard crust and soft interior, as well as tougher-skinned fruits and vegetables.  Granton: This edge has hollowed-out grooves or dimples on the sides of the blade. These grooves fill with the fat and juices of the product being cut, allowing for thin, even cuts without tearing. Even with the grooves, these are still straight-edge knives and can be honed with a sharpening steel.  How should I care for my cutlery?  After use, knives should not be allowed to soak in water. The best practice is to hand wash and dry them immediately. This is especially true if they have been used on fruit or salty foods, which may cause some staining, even on stainless steel. Most knives require very little maintenance and it is worth the effort to protect your investment.  Though Victorinox knives are dishwasher safe, this is strongly discouraged. The dishwasher\u2019s agitation may cause damage. Additionally, harsh detergents can be harmful and cause pitting and spotting on the blades. The handles may also discolor and develop a white film with constant use of the dishwasher. Plus, intense heat associated with dishwashers is not good for the temper of the blade.  How do I keep my knives sharp? All quality knives require proper maintenance to keep them in perfect cutting shape. The best of edges will quickly dull if it strikes metal, glass, or Formica. A wooden cutting board makes the best cutting surface. And, if a slip occurs, a proper cutting board is safer for the user. Frequent use of a Victorinox sharpening steel will keep blades in tip top working condition. All straight-edge knives need steeling to keep their edges.   How to \"Steel\" a Knife 1. Hold the steel firmly in your left hand with the guard positioned to stop the blade should it slip. 2. Hold the knife in your right hand and place on top part of steel as shown. 3. Raise back of blade one-eighth inch. 4. Now, moving the blade only, draw it across the steel in an arching curve, pivoted at your wrist. The blade tip should leave the steel about two-thirds of the way down. 5. Repeat the same action with the Blade on the bottom side of the steel. Always maintain the same pressure and angle on both sides of the steel. 6. Repeat five or six times.  When a sharpening steel no longer does the job, it\u2019s time to take the knife to a qualified knife sharpener who will place a new edge on it. This, along with use of the sharpening steel, will give you many years of sharp, safe blades.  Please note that electric knife sharpeners can be harmful. They have to be used carefully as they remove too much metal, can harm the temper of the blade, and most important can change the factory-applied edge angle.  How should I store my knives?  Safety is the biggest concern of storage, both to the user and to protect the knife's edge. Choices include a knife magnet, knife block, drawer insets, and also individual knife protectors.", "salesrank_2018": "944252"}, "B001AESRNC": {"description": "Paneled door kitchen cart would make a great, small space addition providing a working surface and storage.

This keeps unnatural plastics out of our landfills. The shower curtain will get wet, but will not spray through. The cotton shower curtain will air dry nicely (with proper ventilation) which helps prevent mold growth associated with plastic liners. Hand Crafted This cotton shower curtain is hand-crafted here in the USA of durable and beautiful 7 oz. cotton duck fabric. The white color is bleached in environmentally friendly hydrogen peroxide, with rustproof nickel plated brass grommets. Processed without Chlorine Bleach The cotton shower curtain's natural cotton duck fabric is not organically grown but is processed without chlorine bleach, dyes and finishes normally used in the industry. Helps Resist Mildew and Mold The cotton shower curtain may help resist mildew and mold by drying quickly. After showering simply spread the curtain out so air can dry it, and try not to leave it gathered at one end of the tub. Be sure that your bathroom has good ventilation to ensure proper drying. This curtain does not have the annoying property of billowing out towards the shower spray like lightweight plastic liners do. Good for you and the Environment Using your Cotton Shower Curtain demonstrates your concern for our planet's environment by reducing chemical and plastic use, reducing landfill mess, as well as beautifying your bathroom environment by bringing nature into your everyday life. While this is a practical and natural alternative to plastic shower curtains, natural cotton still does require care, your shower curtain will need to be washed - perhaps weekly if used daily. Please note that we recommend air drying in your dryer - heat may result in shrinkage of up to approximately 3 inches.

With a little advanced preparation and the Set & Forget Programmable Slow Cooker, a deliciously satisfying homemade dinner will be ready to eat when you walk in the door. To make dinnertime easy, the Set & Forget Programmable Slow Cooker offers you three cooking choices: a program mode, a probe mode, and a manual mode. On busy days, program the cooking time and the Set & Forget Slow Cooker automatically shifts to keep warm when the cooking time is up. Cooking a large cut of meat like pot roast, chicken, or pork tenderloin? Insert the probe, set the desired meat temperature and the Set & Forget Slow Cooker automatically shifts to keep warm when the temperature is reached. For traditional slow cooking, manually select the high, low or warm temperature without setting a cooking time.  After you master all the cooking flexibility the Set & Forget Programmable Slow Cooker offers, you may want to take your meals on the road to parties or potlucks. But when it comes to toting hot meals along, spills can be a concern. With the travel-friendly Set & Forget Slow Cooker, messes aren't an issue. When you need to take home-cooked meal out of the house, the Set & Forget Slow Cooker's clip-locked, secure lid has a tight seal to help ensure that your shirt and your car arrive without a messy spill. In or out of the house, the Set & Forget Programmable Slow Cooker not only makes slow cooking easy, it has travel neatly wrapped up.  PRODUCT FEATURE BENEFITS  Three choices for easy, automatic cooking: program mode, probe mode, and manual modeProbe mode is perfect for cooking large cuts of meat or for recipes that require food to reach a certain temperatureThe thermometer probe reads the actual temperature of food as it cooks; the temperature is displayed on the slow cooker control panel Travel-friendly design secures contents en route to parties, potlucks, family gatherings and tailgating The lid securely seals in place with sturdy wire clips on each handle. Convenient serving spoon clips onto lid for easy access 6 quart removable stoneware crock fits a 6 lb. chicken or a 4 lb. roast Wraparound, even heat cooks food evenly and consistently Full-grip handles make carrying heavy meals easier Power interrupt protection keeps slow cooker on during a brief power outage PRODUCT USES  Using the Program Mode If you'll be busy or away when your food is finished cooking, use the PROGRAM mode. It's easy. Simply input the amount of time your food needs to cook and select the HIGH or LOW heat setting. As food cooks, the illuminated display on the control panel will alternate between the heat setting and the remaining time. When the cooking cycle is complete, the Set & Forget Programmable Slow Cooker will automatically shift to WARM setting.   Using the Probe Mode For many foods, especially large cuts of meat, the internal temperature is the best test for doneness. The temperature probe takes the guesswork out of slow cooking. Select the desired internal food temperature and the slow cooker will automatically shift to WARM once the temperature is reached. By using the cooking guide for the PROBE mode below, you can estimate the amount of time the food will need to cook:  Cooking Guide for Probe Mode: NOTE: For 6-quart slow cooker only. Adjust the size and weight of food. If cooking dense vegetables (such as potatoes or other root vegetables) with meats, check for doneness when desired meat temperature is reached. These types of vegetables may take longer to cook when cooked with meats/foods such as those listed in the Cooking Guide above. Using the Manual Mode On days when you want to keep things simple, you can simply select between the HIGH and LOW heat setting to cook your food. When your food is ready, turn the unit OFF or select the WARM setting until you're ready to serve your food.  SLOW COOKER TIPS  If you're not familiar with slow cooking, there are a few things you should know about this method of cooking. First, how high you fill the crock (sometimes called the insert pan, stoneware, cookware or vessel) is important. To prevent overcooking, the crock should be filled half-full to no more than one inch from the rim. However, this does not mean to fill the crock with liquid. If cooking soups or stews, leave a 2-inch (5 cm) space between the top of the crock and the food so the recipe can come to a simmer.  Secondly, if you lift the lid during cooking, your cooking time will increase due to heat loss. Unless your recipe specifically calls for stirring, resist lifting the lid. Last but not least, if you want to store leftovers after cooking, do NOT place the entire crock in the refrigerator since contents will take too long to cool. Instead, divide leftovers into smaller containers and place in the refrigerator.  Cooking Meat  A slow cooker is great for foods that are not naturally tender, such as meat with a lot of connective tissue. These are the least-expensive cuts but also the most flavorful. Like braising, slow cookers tenderize meat slowly as it cooks. If you choose cuts such as chuck roast, pork butt, short ribs or chicken thighs, you won't be disappointed with the results. If fat is an issue, refrigerate the contents after cooking and skim off the extra fat before serving. Note: you must thaw frozen meat and poultry before adding it to the slow cooker. Cooking Side Dishes or Dessert  Main courses, soups and \"one-pot\" meals are not the only things that slow cookers are great for preparing. They are also perfect for making side dishes and dessert, especially when your main oven is full. Check out the recipes found at HamiltonBeach.com that were developed and tested by the culinary experts in the Hamilton Beach Test Kitchen. How to Adapt Recipes You can convert your favorite recipes to slow cooker recipes if you learn these important differences first:  Liquids do not evaporate in a slow cooker. So unless you are cooking rice, pasta, or beans, reduce amount of liquid to 1/2 of the amount called for in your recipe.Fresh vegetables produce the most desirable results. Potatoes, carrots, onions and garlic should be washed and cut in uniform pieces, then placed in the bottom of the crock. Canned and frozen vegetables take less time to cook and can produce overcooked dishes.Ground beef should be browned and drained before slow cooking to remove grease.Tender foods such as pasta, asparagus and snow peas should be added in the last hour of cooking.Dairy products such as cheese, milk, and sour cream should be added in the last half hour of cooking.Seafood such as shrimp, scallops, and fish should be added in the last 15-30 minutes of cooking.  CARE AND CLEANING The removable stoneware crock and the lid are dishwasher safe. To clean the base, unplug and let cool, and then wipe it down with a damp cloth. Do not immerse the cord, plug or base in any liquid. Some slow cookers have steam vent holes in their lids; the Set & Forget Programmable Slow Cooker has a probe hole. If you are not inserting the probe for using probe mode, leave the hole open and do not plug it with paper towels or other objects. Vent holes allow steam to escape and the wattage of the unit has been adjusted to compensate for any heat loss. Which Hamilton Beach Slow Cooker is Right for You?

Convenient food-storage containers Airtight and watertight Made of high-quality BPA-free plastic Food-safe and hygienic 4-sided locking system with silicone seal Durable construction Stackable and nestable for space-saving storage Microwave- and dishwasher-safe Available in a variety of shapes and sizes    Lock&Lock Food-Storage Solutions Save Food, Save Money, Save Space A useful addition to any busy household, Lock&Lock's Classic plastic food-storage containers come in handy for storing fresh and frozen foods--from healthy snacks like cut-up fruits and vegetables to leftovers or dinners for the week. They also work well for keeping pasta, rice, flour, sugar, crackers, cookies, and other cupboard or pantry items fresh for longer, securely stored, and neatly organized. Even more, the versatile storage containers can be used to transport lunches to and from work or school--or even for storing smaller kitchen, office, or craft items. Lock&Lock's full line of Classic food-storage containers offers a wide range of shapes and sizes--each with a securely locking lid for airtight storage and peace of mind. Furthermore, the clear body of the containers makes identifying contents easy--no labels required.    Ideal for wet or dry food storage. Airtight Containers with Four-Sided Locking System    Lock&Lock's Classic food-storage containers feature an innovative four-sided locking system for an airtight seal and watertight storage so food stays fresh longer and there's no messy leaks or spills to worry about. The four sides of the locking system promote an airtight seal due to equal pressure to all four sides, along with the hollow-center silicon sealing ring that makes it possible to lock tightly (the silicone sealing ring can be removed for cleaning if necessary). Made of high-quality BPA-free plastic, Lock&Lock's Classic food-storage containers not only offer an airtight and watertight seal, but they're also durably built for unbreakable, long-lasting use and hygienic, food-safe storage. The containers can withstand temperatures ranging from -4 degrees F to 210 degrees F, making them suitable for use in the freezer, microwave* (reheating only), and dishwasher (top-rack). The base and lid should NOT be used in the oven, under browning elements, or on the stove top. Another thoughtful design detail includes the fact that the containers can be nested together, and with the lid in place, they can be stacked one on top of the other--particularly useful where space is limited. *Unlock all four latches and loosen lid before use in microwave. Detailed Features Patented Blocking Hole System    Consistent flow of resin--does not produce a weld line along the hinge. Inconsistent flow of resin--produces a weld line over time.   Lock&Lock Classic lids feature four side flaps or \"wings\" that are hinged and slightly flared at the end for an easy grip when opening. More importantly, they come with holes (rectangular-shaped openings) that line up with matching knobs on the base of the containers, making it easy to latch the lid to the base, locking it into place. This patented blocking hole system maintains the integrity of the lid and helps promote an easy, tightly locked container.  Lid's 4 wings come with holes that line up with base Weld line does not form around the hinge piece Hinge is designed to be short in length to prevent stiffness when opening and closing    Blue hollow-center silicon band in the lid helps create an airtight, leak-proof seal. Special Silicone In addition to its blocking hole system, the Classic food-storage containers feature a blue hollow-center silicon ring in the lid that helps create an airtight, leak-proof seal. Generic silicon with a solid center doesn't compress as well and doesn't have the same restorative power as hollow-center silicon, which means an inferior seal. Lock&Lock's hollow-center silicon seal delivers superior compression and restoration power that helps ensure an airtight seal. Permeability When testing the freshness of foods, one of the most important factors is the permeability of the container. In comparison to other brands, the permeability of Lock&Lock products showed to be drastically better.   Strawberries stored at room temperature for 5 days. The freshness test is determined throughout the world by how much moisture permeates various containers. Test results show Lock&Lock airtight containers allow in 3,000 - 6,000 times less moisture than other containers, making them far more airtight.   Airtight seal means no messy spills or leaks to worry about. Excellent Airtight Seal Lock&Lock airtight containers passed the leakage test. Their four-sided locking system makes an airtight seal possible due to equal pressure on all four sides and the hollow-center silicone sealing ring.   Passed the KEMTI bending test. Durable Design Lock&Lock airtight containers have also passed the KEMTI bending test. The container and the wing were fixed to the bending test machine and bent 3,000,000 times 80 degrees left to right. If the container were to be used 10 times a day, it could be used for 821 years (semi-permanently).   Hygienic and food-safe. Healthy Living Lock&Lock Classic food-storage containers have passed the strict hygiene and safety tests of the U.S. FDA and German SGS. Made of high-quality BPA-free plastic, the durable and heat-resistance containers are food-safe and health-friendly.   Nest and stack for space-saving storage. Space-Saving Design When not in use, the cleverly designed food-storage containers nest together, both lids and bases, for compact storage in a drawer or on a shelf. The containers also offer a stacking system for maximum space efficiency. The flat lids make it easy to stack one container on top of another--a slight edge helps to keep stacked items in securely place, whether in the freezer, refrigerator, or cupboard. Whether just one or building a collection of several, Lock&Lock's Classic airtight containers offer a smart solution for food storage.

Because of its 8-cup capacity and elegant design, this French press is great for dinner parties, where you can now brew your guests' coffee right at the table. The Chambord press includes all the Bodum features you've come to expect: a polished stainless lid and holder, wide black handle and knob that stay cool, and a durable glass carafe. To use, simply measure out one rounded tablespoon of coarsely ground coffee per 4-ounce cup, pour in the hot water, wait a few minutes for it to brew, and slowly press down the plunger.  Uniquely designed, the two 12-ounce glasses are double-walled to resist heat and prevent condensation. So no matter what temperature the beverage is, the glasses remain comfortable to hold and safe for any tabletop. Crafted of borosilicate glass, which is also used to make scientific lab equipment, the pair is exceptionally strong, lightweight, and thermal. The scratch-resistant glasses are dishwasher- and microwave safe.  Editor's Note: Because the glasses are mouth blown, each one may have slight variations in height, thickness, and weight. Bodum recommends using care when placing ice into the glass to avoid fracturing the inner layer. Do not use metal spoons or place the glass into a crowded dishwasher.  Instructions for Use   1. Place pot on a dry, flat, nonslip surface. Hold handle firmly, then pull the plunger straight up and out of the pot.  2. For each 1.25-deciliter/4-ounce cup, put 1 rounded tablespoon or 1 Bodum scoop of coarse-ground coffee into the pot.  Caution: Use only coarse-ground coffee. Fine grind can clog the filter and create high pressure. Place coffee maker on a heatproof, nonslip surface.  3. Pour hot (not boiling) water into the pot. Leave a minimum of 2.5 centimeters/1 inch of space at the top. Stir the brew with a plastic spoon.  Caution: Metal spoons can scratch or chip the glass beaker and cause breakage.  4. Place the plunger unit on top of the pot. Turn lid to close off the pour spout opening. (Does not apply to the Brazil models.) Do not press down. Let the coffee brew for at least 4 minutes.  5. Hold the pot handle firmly, with the spout turned away from you, then using just the weight of your hand, apply slight pressure on top of the knob to lower the plunger straight down into the pot. Lowering the plunger slowly with minimal pressure produces best results. If the filter clogs or it becomes difficult to push down the plunger you should remove the plunger from the pot, stir the brew, and then slowly plunge again.  WARNING: Using excessive force can cause scalding liquid to shoot out of the pot.  6. Turn the lid to open the pour spout and then pour coffee.  7. Unscrew the filter assembly and clean the plunger unit after each use. All parts are dishwasher-safe.   Safety Instructions  Not for stovetop use. Check glass beaker for scratches, cracks, or chips. Do not use a pot that is scratched, chipped, or cracked. Install a replacement beaker before using the pot again. Keep children away while using. Hot water is a hazard to small children! Do not allow children to use this coffeemaker.  Scald Hazard  Excessive plunging force can cause scalding hot liquid to shoot out of pot. Do not plunge with force. Turn lid to close spout. Use only coarse-ground coffee. ", "salesrank_2018": "600951"}, "B001B8LZCC": {"description": "Sure to inspire oohs & ahhs, the cake you make with our turkey pan will be the star of the table.

These stoneware pieces features Le Creuset's legendary raised rings and a perfectly matched pallete of signature shades.  Each piece of Le Creuset dinnerware is crafted in the same careful process as all Le Creuset stoneware - with a colorful, durable exterior enamel that matches other stoneware flawlessly while protecting from utensil marks and scratches. Every plate, bowl and mug is designed to complement any collection of stoneware, and is finished with Le Creuset's signature three-ring accent along the exterior.  Features High-quality exterior enamel protects against metal marks and other damageHard-wearing, impermeable finish fired at temperatures as high as 2192 degrees F is safe for cutting on with knivesUnmatched thermal resistance from -65 degrees F to 500 degrees F -- safe for the freezer, microwave, oven, broiler and dishwasherLess than 1% porosity, blocking moisture absorption which can lead to cracking, crazing and rippling along the interiorUnique clay mixture that creates a very dense material when fired, maintaining even temperatures and preventing scorchingResistant to staining and flavor/odor absorptionA perfectly color-matched palette of bold, consistent tones for easy mixing and matching with other Le Creuset products    Introduction All items in the Le Creuset stoneware range are original designs and have been hand-crafted, making each piece unique. Due to this uniqueness, there may be slight variations from piece to piece. Le Creuset Stoneware is safe for use in the microwave, freezer, refrigerator, dishwasher, oven and broiler. The maximum oven-safe temperature is 500 degrees F / 260 degrees C. The enameled surface is easy to clean and scratch-resistant. The enamel is completely hygienic and will not absorb odors or flavors. Le Creuset Stoneware is extremely strong and durable, and resists staining, chipping and cracking. The handles, knobs and rims have been designed for a secure, easy-to-hold grip. Cleaning and Care DO NOT use any Stoneware piece on the stovetop or any other direct heat source. OVEN: Maximum oven-safe temperature is 500 degrees F / 260 degrees C. Use oven mitts for lifting at all times. BROILER: When using under a broiler allow a gap of no less than 2 1/2 inches between the rim of the dish and the heat source. MICROWAVE: Handles may become hot during prolonged microwave use, especially if the handles are enclosed with plastic wrap. Cover just the open top of the dish, leaving the handles exposed. FREEZER-TO-OVEN USE: Do not place a frozen dish of food in a preheated oven. Place the frozen dish in a cold oven and set the temperature, allowing the dish and oven to heat together. Before serving always check that the center of the food is completely and uniformly hot. CLEANING: Before the first use, wash the dish in hot, soapy water, and rinse and dry thoroughly. For most day-to-day cleaning, cool the dish for a few minutes before washing and drying, or wash in the dishwasher, allowing the full cycle to complete. Never leave a dish fully immersed in water. For removal of stubborn residues allow the dish to cool, fill with warm, soapy water and allow it to soak for 10 to 20 minutes. Wash in the usual way using a plastic brush or scouring pad if necessary.

Simply add the ingredients, choose from several options using the touch-pad controls, and it takes care of the rest. It will mix the ingredients, knead the dough, let it rise, and bake it to perfection--soft on the inside and crispy on the outside. Choose from 12 preprogrammed menu options; 1-, 1-1/2-, and 2-pound loaf sizes; and three crust settings--light, medium, or dark. Other highlights include a 13-hour delay-start timer, a removable lid with a viewing window, power-failure backup, sturdy stay-cool handles, and a removable kneading paddle and bread pan for easy cleanup. Accessories include a measuring cup, a measuring spoon, and foolproof recipes for gluten-free breads, as well as jams and sauces. Mix-ins must be added at the very beginning of the cycle with other basic ingredient. With its modern design and embossed logo, the bread machine measures 18 by 12-1/5 by 15 inches.  From the Manufacturer     Nothing says \u201chome\u201d like warm, just-baked bread. With this programmable automatic breadmaker from Cuisinart, all you have to do is add ingredients and select the time you\u2019d like it to start the process. The breadmaker mixes it, kneads it, and bakes it. It also come with lots of bread recipes, as well as recipes for pastries and jams. You\u2019ll discover you\u2019ve bought yourself much more than a breadmaker (while still enjoying the lovely smell and taste of homemade bread). For safety, this unit is equipped with a power failure backup system. In case of any disruption of power supply, the unit will store in memory the stage of bread making cycle and resume once power is restored. The power back up feature can maintain memory for a power failure up to 15 minutes. And for easy clean up, the removable pan and paddle, cup, and spoon are dishwasher safe. The removable lid and touchpad control wipe clean with a damp cloth; fewer crevices make the unit easier to clean.     Easy-to-Use Control Panel         LCD Display: Displays loaf size and crust color selection along with the current function. Also used to view menu selection and delay start timer, which allows you to delay the bread-making process up to 13 hours. Loaf Size Button: Selects a 1-pound, 1-1/2-pound, or 2-pound loaf. Crust Color Button: Selects a light, medium or dark crust. Menu Button: Selects program. Program List: Lists the first 11 preprogrammed menu selections: use the menu button to select from this list:  Basic/White: The white bread cycle uses primarily white flour. French/Italian: French/Italian breads require special timing and temperatures to achieve that wonderful crispy, nicely browned crust. Whole Wheat Bread: This is a yeast bread made with a significant portion of whole wheat flour (50% or more). Breads made from whole wheat flour are more nutritious because the flour is milled from the entire wheat berry (including the bran and the germ). Using whole wheat flour produces a bread that is brown to dark brown in color (when all the whole wheat flour is used). Sweet Bread: The sweet bread program is specifically designed to bake breads with high amounts of sugar, fats, and proteins. These added ingredients tend to increase browning of the finished loaves. Gluten Free: One in approximately 100 people has an allergy or sensitivity to gluten. Since gluten is found in most flours used in traditional bread making, the ingredients to create gluten free breads are unique. While they are \u201cyeast breads\u201d, the doughs are generally wet and have a batter-like consistency. It is also important not over-mix or over-knead gluten free doughs. There is only one rise, and due to the high moisture content, baking time is increased. Mix-ins must be added at the very beginning of the cycle with other basic ingredients. Packaged Mix: This program is for prepackaged yeast bread mixes--the 1-1/2 and 2 pound dough mixes work best. Cake/Quick Bread: Cake-like in texture, and referred to as batter breads in some cookbooks, these are usually baked in a shaped pan such as a muffin tin or loaf pan. They get their leavening from baking powder, baking soda, and eggs. Mix-ins must be added at the very beginning of the cycle with other basic ingredients. If a quick bread is a little moist on top when baking is complete (moisture will depend on ingredients of the quick bread), leave it in the bread maker for an extra 10 to 15 minutes with no heat, and it will continue baking. Dough: There are two ways to prepare dough in the bread maker if you wish to bake it in a conventional oven. One way is by using the Dough cycle. It mixes ingredients, kneads and takes the dough through the first rise cycle. It is appropriate for almost any dough recipe (except gluten free) and ideal for pizza dough. It is intended that dough will be removed, deflated, and shaped by hand and allowed to rise 1 or 2 more times out of the bread maker. Alternatively, you can choose a specific bread type from the menu options, and remove the dough when the signal before the last rise sounds. Pasta Dough: The pasta dough program mixes and kneads pasta dough perfectly. It is intended for the dough to be removed and rested. Once rested the dough can either be rolled by hand or placed through a pasta roller. Jams: The breadmaker is a great cooking environment for homemade jams and chutneys. The paddle automatically keeps the ingredients stirring through the process. The heating element is placed in a way that the contents of the pot will not get burned. Recipes are included in the Instruction Book. Bake-Only: This activates the breadmaker for bake function only, and can be set in 10 minutes intervals up to 90 minutes. You can use this setting if you want the finished loaf to have darker crust or to bake store-purchased doughs. Rapid Bake: The rapid cycle must be used with a recipe using rapid rise yeast, or the bread will not rise and bake properly.  Delay Start Timer Buttons: Set the delay start timer. Start/Stop Button: Starts and stops the bread maker process     Handy Options Mix-Ins: During the last 8 minutes of the second kneading cycle for several on selected programs an audible signal of 5 short beeps will sound to remind you to add any additional ingredients your recipe requires (such as nuts and seeds, raisins and dried fruits, shredded chesses, chocolate morsels).  After Mixing/Kneading is completed there will be an audible signal of 6 short beeps, before the last rise cycle, indicating the point at which the mixing/kneading is complete. At this point in the bread making process you have the option of removing the kneading paddle, to avoid a small hole in the bottom of your baked loaf, and/or re-shaping the dough, though neither is necessary.   After Breadmaking  There will be a series of 15 beeps to signal the end of the baking cycle: the bread display window will read 00:00 and the unit will be in the Warm Cycle. Your bread will be kept warm for 60 minutes to prevent it from becoming soggy. For optimal results, we recommend removing the loaf as soon as the baking cycle is complete and letting it cool on a baking rack. All breads slice best when allowed to cool for a minimum of 30 minutes before slicing.  Bringing the Good Life Home Cuisinart products are designed to make life delicious all day long.
