The machine\u2019s cleaner head has an active base plate, which self-adjusts automatically for optimal contact with all floor types. On hard floors the base plate lowers to create an efficient seal, and the brush bar lifts clear off the floor to protect delicate surfaces. On carpet the base plate rises and the brush bar lowers for optimum bristle penetration \u2013 removing ground-in dirt and pet hair from different depths of carpet pile. And because the cleaner head adjusts automatically, there are no dials and you don\u2019t need to bend down to make adjustments.    Dyson cyclones capture more dirt than any other cyclone. DC41 Animal has Radial Root Cyclone technology with remodeled airflows to maximize suction power. It also comes with a Mini turbine head to clean pet hair and dirt from confined spaces, upholstery, stairs and the car. DC41 Animal also has patented Ball technology. It turns on the spot, which allows you to manoeuvre more easily around obstacles and into awkward spaces. And because the motor and other key technologies are located in the ball, there are fewer components on the outside of the machine. This makes it easier to steer closer to edges.   Patented Dyson Technology New Radial Root Cyclone Technology Ordinary vacuum cleaners rely on bags to trap dust and dirt. As you use them, the tiny holes in the bag clog up with particles of dust. This restricts the flow of air, so the vacuum cleaner loses suction. Dyson vacuum cleaners don\u2019t rely on bags to trap dust and dirt. They use cyclone technology, which spins the air at incredibly high speeds. The cyclones inside a Dyson vacuum cleaner generate centrifugal forces many thousands of times the force of gravity. Dust, dirt and pet hair are flung out of the airflow and straight into the bin. No bag. No loss of suction.  Dyson has been continually refining cyclone vacuum technology since inventing it more than 20 years ago. DC41 Animal has new Radial Root Cyclone technology. Reconfigured air channels and improved flow efficiency reduce turbulence and preserve air pressure, so that the inner cyclones can extract more microscopic particles. These refinements help remove more dirt, dust, allergens and pet hair from the airflow.  Ball Technology to Help You Steer with Ease Dyson Ball upright vacuum cleaners use patented Ball technology to overcome the steering limitations of fixed wheels. They ride on a ball, which turns on the spot so you can steer with ease, changing direction with just a turn of the wrist.   The ball itself is made of glass-reinforced polypropylene- the same material used in the manufacture of car dashboards. It combines high impact strength with the resistance to distortion. The ball also holds the heaviest component, (the motor), positioned towards the base for a lower center of gravity and greater stability.  Features Self-adjusting cleaner head:  DC41 Animal has an active base plate. It creates the optimal cleaner head contact for every floor type, reducing air leaks and retaining suction power on all floor types \u2013 wood, carpet, vinyl and tile.  Mini turbine head to remove pet hair from awkward spaces: Pet hair can gather in hard to reach places and stick to upholstery. The Mini turbine head attaches to the machine\u2019s wand to remove hair from confined spaces that would otherwise be hard to reach.  Instant release wand:  DC41 Animal has an instant release, long reach wand for cleaning stairs and hard to reach areas \u2013 it stretches up to 5 times in length. There are no separate parts to assemble.   Extra tools: DC41 Animal comes with a Combination tool and a Stair tool. The Combination tool has a debris nozzle that converts to a brush tool for dusting. The Stair tool removes dirt and dust from corners and against vertical edges of stairs.  Captures allergens, expels cleaner air:  Dyson cyclones capture microscopic particles down to 0.5 microns in size, including pollen, mold and bacteria.  Approved for allergy sufferers:  All new Dyson upright and canister vacuums are certified asthma & allergy friendly by the Asthma & Allergy Foundation of America. Dyson cyclones capture microscopic particles down to 0.5 microns in size, including pollen, mold and bacteria.  5-Year Warranty DC41 Animal floor comes with a 5 year warranty - parts and labor guaranteed by Dyson.

The two heater modules can be used combined like a traditional vertical heater, or they can be separated to direct heat in two places. The unique tethered heater modules can be placed up to 9-feet apart- one on either side of the bed, one on each side of a chair, or aimed at two different people. The two zones combined with the digital thermostat are perfect to give you precision control over your comfort. Two Zone Feature The Two Zone Story Ambia's two zone idea was born from the frustration in trying to find the perfect position for a single heater. No matter how hard you try, it\u2019s just impossible to perfect the position. Either one person sits comfortably in a room while another is cold or hands freeze while feet bake. We knew we needed to add another dimension to space heaters, and to allow everyone to be comfortable. That\u2019s when the Ambia line of two zone heaters was born. A two zone heater allows you to customize your comfort with modules that you can separate and position, like surround sound speakers. No longer will you have to choose who or what stays warm. Perfect For So Many Uses Ambia\u2019s ACH-220 two zone tower heater is ideal for a host of situations. You can set one module on each side of a bed, or simply set both modules facing one chair to create a cozy envelope of heat. You can even set each module to face different people in the same room so everyone can be comfortable. With the Ambia ACH-120 you can truly customize your comfort. Features and Specifications Adjustable Thermostat It\u2019s easy to dial in to the perfect temperature setting and then choose between heating the left, right, or both modules for the perfect level of comfort--every time. It\u2019s also easy to store, with handy cord storage that lets you keep your tether cord stored neatly in the rear compartment to prevent clutter.

And, its benefits don't stop there. The Scoop Coffeemaker utilizes the simplicity of ground coffee and brews a customizable cup quickly: an 8 oz. cup in less than 90 seconds or a 14 oz. travel mug in under two-and-a-half minutes. Aside from its versatility in using inexpensive coffee grounds to brew a great-tasting cup, The Scoop Coffeemaker is designed for ultra-simple preparation in three straightforward steps: 1) Scoop 2) Place 3) Brew. It features a steel mesh scoop for filtering freshly ground coffee and comes with a built-in, adjustable stand that flips to accommodate a standard-size cup or a taller travel mug. All in all, The Scoop Single-Serve Coffeemaker offers affordability and no fuss with lots of options. There's no need for extra equipment, high-tech buttons or extra equipment, either.  Product Uses & Unique Features Allowing for Various Coffee Grind Types The Scoop Coffeemaker doesn't need pre-packaged K-Cup packs or coffee pods, which can get expensive, and not to mention stale, over time. Instead, it comes with a mesh scoop filter that gives users the choice of any flavor (caramel, hazelnut, vanilla, etc), any brand (Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts, etc.) and any strength (Regular or Bold) pleasing to their taste.  Differing Boldness Levels With The Scoop Coffeemaker, versatility is key. Whether you decide to go with a mainstream brand coffee or stronger premium-brand coffee, you need a machine that understands and quickly adapts. Use the REGULAR setting for a quick basic, automatic drip coffee, or get an upgrade and choose BOLD for more fine grinds, decaf or stronger flavors premium-brand coffee like Starbucks or Melitta. Just remember that the finer the grind, the longer it takes to brew. For bolder coffee, the water passes through at a slower rate, but allows more contact time and better flavor extraction for a better-tasting cup when done brewing.  Measuring Proportions Appropriately  Not sure how much coffee to add when brewing? No worries -- each scoop filter is labeled with two measuring lines for exact serving amounts. And more isn't necessarily better, in this case. Overfilling the scoop doesn't allow room for brewing and water can overflow and spill over, ultimately meaning weaker coffee.  Adjusting the Cup Size  Before brewing, adjust the L-shaped cup rest to make sure your cup is as close to the dispensing nozzle as possible. For travel mugs, fit the cup rest against the coffeemaker and place your mug on top of the drip tray.  Award-Winning Design  The Scoop Coffeemaker was awarded the \"2012 Good Housekeeping Very Innovative Products (VIP) Award\" by Good Housekeeping Research Institute. In addition, the Industrial Designers Society of America (IDSA) gave it high rankings for its ability to use coffee grinds, instead of packs or pods, and simultaneously give users the freedom to choose their own flavor, strength and cup size for their coffee.  Product Feature Benefits Costs pennies per cup, compared to leading competitors' single-size packsProportions coffee exactly with single-serve scoop filter Brews an 8 oz. cup of coffee in less than 90 seconds Built-in adjustable stand holds standard-size cup and taller travel mugs One steel mesh scoop filter included; no need for paper filtersWide drip tray on base acts as a spill-resistant drain for excess coffee Settings for REGULAR (automatic drip) and BOLD coffee Durable, stainless steel features ensure coffeemaker's longevity Automatically shuts off after brewing Tips & Care  Run one or two cycles through the machine before first use. When one cycle is complete, the coffeemaker automatically shuts off. When grinding your own coffee beans, remember to purchase beans that were recently roasted (within a week is best), and grind them every time you brew a fresh cup. When brewing, keep ground coffee below the MAX fill line and do not use more than 14 ounces (410 ml) of water. To stop brewing mid-cycle, press either REGULAR or BOLD, and the unit will shut off. If there is no water in the water reservoir and a brew button is pushed, the unit will not brew.  ", "salesrank_2018": "101881"}, "B005GVXCDU": {"description": "Giarraffa Co.

With a Nesco Roaster Oven you can roast, bake, cook, steam, slow cook and serve. Other than broiling, the Nesco Roaster Oven can do anything a normal oven can do but better and with less energy usage and less heat generated in the kitchen. The Roaster Oven is portable so you can make great tasting meals wherever you go. The exclusive \"Circle of Heat\" heating element wraps around for moist, even cooking. The automatic temperature control maintains even cooking temperatures from 200 degrees to 450 degrees. Removable steel rack has easy lift out handles for safe, easy insertion and removal of hot foods.  The stainless steel cookwell is specially designed for the demands of commercial food preparation and volume cooking. The Cookwell is also popular for home cooking, among people who appreciate the appearance and durability of stainless steel.   Easy to Clean Removable Cookwell Features: Stay cool handlesStainless-steel exteriorChrome-plated cooking/baking rackStainless steel cookwell Detailed Highlights: 1425 Watts of Power: Can do everything a traditional oven does, except broil. Adjustable Full Range Temperature Control to 450 degrees: Roasts, bakes, steams, slow cooks, and warms. Automatic temperature control maintains even cooking temperatures. Removable Cookwell: Stainless Steel cookwell that is dishwasher safe for easy clean-up. Removable Steel Rack: Designed for better baking and fat-free roasting.

Watts/Volts/Hz: 1425/120/60   Foods Cooked from the Side, Not the Bottom Why Use A Roaster Oven? A roaster can be used for doing all cooking and baking functions and it is easier to clean than your conventional oven. It can be a moveable main cooking appliance at some times and a valued supplementary appliance at other times. Use it on hot days instead of your large oven to keep your kitchen cooler. Roasters slow cook just like a slow cooker, but do so much more. Roasters have better construction than slow cookers. Roasters have better thermostats than a slow cooker to accommodate the higher temperatures required for roasting and baking. The removable cook wells of roasters can be stored in the refrigerator and washed in the dishwasher. Roaster ovens support the current trend of comfort foods, saving money on cheaper cuts of meat, preparing soups, stew, chili and casseroles at home for the family. There is increased interest in eating family meals together and eating healthier. Our aging population is also interested in creating healthier meals. Rectangular shape and squared off corners make it roomy enough for baking and for all of your favorite recipes.  Use these everyday roaster ovens to keep foods such as baked beans, German potato salad, vegetables, appetizers and dips at serving temperature. The handy rack can be covered with aluminum foil and can be used as a mini baking sheet.   Automatic Temperature Control Curing Your Roaster before Use Before Using the Roaster Unpack your NESCO Roaster Oven completely REMOVING ALL PACKAGING MATERIAL AND INFORMATION LABELS.  Remove Lid (cover), Rack, and Cookwell, (from heatwell) wash them and set aside.  Place Roaster Oven (Heatwell only) in a well-ventilated area. Make sure temperature knob is set at the lowest possible setting/off.  Plug in Heatwell cord to a 120 volt AC outlet. Turn temperature knob to maximum setting and cure Roaster Oven empty for 60 minutes (or longer) until any odor or wisps of smoke disappear. Some smoke and odor are a normal part of \"curing\" the element and will not reoccur in cooking use. When curing is completed, turn temperature control to lowest setting/off, unplug unit from outlet and allow cooling. After your unit has cooled, put Cookwell, Lid, and Rack back in and it is ready to use. Do not cook food without Cookwell in place.

It can be stored flat or on its side to take up less counter space.    Why the Breville Sous Chef Food Processor? Every Breville product begins with a simple moment of brilliance. The Breville Sous Chef began with the observation that the food comes in many different shapes and sizes, making it difficult for one machine to consistently cut all ingredients into the optimal size pieces. So how do you make sure that you get the perfect size for what you\u2019re cooking? The Breville Sous Chef solves this problem with its unique design. Its wide feed chute makes it possible to slice vegetables of all shapes and sizes, while numerous disc and blade options makes it easy to get perfect results, any way you slice it. Combining Convenience and Versatility: the greatest sliced thing since bread Food processors are supposed to make food prep easier, not more frustrating. The Breville Sous Chef has a 5.5\u201d Super Wide Feed Chute that reduces the need to pre-cut most fruits & veggies, saving you time. The Breville Sous Chef comes with a set of 8 discs and blades for numerous prep options, all housed in a convenient accessory storage. The discs include a variable slicing disc that can be set to 24 different slicing settings so you can customize the thickness of your slices from a paper thin 0.3mm all the way up to a thick 8.0mm. Other discs in the set include a julienne disc, a French fry cutting disc, a whisking disc, and a reversible shredding disc, while the blades include a micro-serrated universal S blade, a dough blade for kneading and combining ingredients, and a mini blade for use with mini-bowl.

Most drip machines simply drip water over the coffee grounds to make coffee, but coffee needs to be steeped in hot water for full-bodied taste. The Breville YouBrew began with the question: how do you brew the perfect cup of coffee from a drip coffee machine? The Breville YouBrew makes it possible for you to make your ideal cup of coffee with its unique coffee brewing system. In the single cup mode, the Breville YouBrew holds the coffee and water together for a stronger, more flavorful cup. The process is similar to how a French Press coffeemaker works, which allows the coffee and water to steep together for 4 minutes before drinking. This gives you more control over the flavor of your coffee. Simply choose your favorite bean and roast, choose your preferred strength, and choose your ideal flavor profile, and the YouBrew\u2019s intelligent Brew IQ system does the rest. Your choice, your coffee nirvana, Breville\u2019s YouBrew. This is how the Breville YouBrew stands apart: it simplifies coffee-making but still makes it possible for you to customize your perfect cup.   A single-serve coffee machine that can multi-task Single-serve coffee machines have made brewing coffee more convenient, but many of them don\u2019t offer much flexibility in cup size, steeping time, or the amount of grounds used (especially if you\u2019re using pre-manufactured coffee pods). The YouBrew navigates all the variables that make the perfect cup of coffee, from customizing brew strength (by adjusting the amount of coffee grounds used) and flavor (by varying the steeping time) to measuring and heating the right amount of water. You\u2019re also not limited to just one cup of coffee; the YouBrew can be used to brew both single-cup servings and multi-cup servings. The Breville YouBrew can brew from around 7.5 oz up to 12 cups of coffee, ensuring that you\u2019ll never have more\u2014or less\u2014coffee than you need. No matter how much water or how many coffee beans you put in the machine, you can adjust the amount of coffee made since the YouBrew measures the volume of water and beans used before making each batch. No more arguments over the last cup, no more wasted coffee. You can brew into a cup, travel mug, or carafe\u2014the YouBrew makes it easy no matter the size.  Coffee how you like it... People who love coffee know what they love: whether it\u2019s strong, bold, smooth, or delicate, coffee aficionados have their preferences. How can one coffee machine cater to their needs? The YouBrew allows you to adjust the strength and flavor profile of your single-cup serving. Seven different strength settings from mild to strong to intense and a choice of five different flavor profiles from light to bold give you more control over how much flavor is extracted from the grounds. Based on your preferences, the YouBrew adjusts the volume of coffee beans ground and the steeping time needed for your perfect cup. Don\u2019t know what you like, or change your mind frequently? With the YouBrew, you can experiment with different strengths and flavors until you find the one that\u2019s just right for you.

If you\u2019re in a hurry when you\u2019re making a carafe of coffee, the Brew Pause feature allows you to pour a cup for yourself in the middle of the brew cycle so you don\u2019t have to wait for the whole carafe to finish. It\u2019s coffee that\u2019s ready to go when you are.

Perfection requires precision. Every time. How do you keep precise temperature and pressure from the tank to the espresso cup? The Breville Dual Boiler\u2019s dedicated boilers for simultaneous milk texturing and espresso extraction ensures that your espresso arrives in its cup with the optimum flavor. Commercial performance in a domestic footprint A domestic machine with numerous professional features, it regulates temperature to within one degree Celsius of the optimal temperature, giving budding baristas the precision and control they need to perfect their technique. Actively heated group head, PID temperature control, over-pressure valve and low pressure pre-infusion maintain optimum temperature and pressure throughout extraction. Espresso yourself: tools for precise personalizing and perfecting Ultimately there is only one standard by which espresso should be measured: taste. And espresso taste is notorious for being a matter of preference. The Breville Dual Boiler gives you the tools to customize your espresso to your personal specifications, with the ability to program shot temperature with precise PID temperature regulation technology, shot volume (1 and 2 cup), and pre-infusion duration and power. You can also program it to auto start, so it will be warmed up and ready to go in the morning.    Extraction pressure and low pressure pre-infusion Temperature Simultaneous steam   Limiting the maximum pressure throughout extraction produces a balanced espresso with an aromatic crema: too little pressure during extraction leads to espresso that is thin and under-developed, but too much pressure during extraction can lead to bitter flavors. The Breville Dual Boiler has low-pressure infusion with programmable pressure and duration, a feature seen in high-grade commercial espresso machines but not in domestic thermoblock systems. Maximum extraction pressure is achieved with an Over-Pressure Valve (OPV) for optimal espresso flavor. Low pressure pre-infusion gradually increases water pressure at the start of the extraction to gently expand grinds for an even extraction (power & duration is user programmable).  Precise and stable water temperature is required for optimum espresso flavor. Water temperature that is too low can lead to espresso which is sour, too high can lead to ashy or bitter flavors. The dedicated stainless steel espresso boiler with electronic PID control technology delivers precise water temperature with variation of only one degree Celsius, based on tests conducted by Breville (2011). The actively heated group head maintains thermal stability throughout extraction, controlled by PID technology. The stainless steel heat exchanger delivers pre-heated water to the espresso boiler via the steam boiler, aiding thermal stability for optimal extraction temperature.  If combining the textured milk and espresso is delayed, the crema may dissipate or lose its flavor. The ability to texture milk whilst extracting espresso, which allows you to immediately combine the two, ensures that the delicate aromatics of the crema are captured. This produces a creamier texture with more complex flavors.

This is how the Breville Hemisphere Control stands apart: no matter what you put in it, it can consistently and evenly whip up the perfect blend.  Even blending, every time Declared one of the best blenders of 2012 by a leading rater of kitchen products, the Breville Hemisphere Control uses an innovative design: extra wide stainless steel blades are contoured to sweep along the base of the jug and push ingredients up while central blades pull ingredients down. It's no wonder this blender has been called the best of 2012: this sleek design minimizes food traps and eliminates the need to dig ingredients out from under the blades or mix up ingredients by hand. Five speeds (including snow, mix, blend, liquefy, and puree) are supplemented by pulse, ice crush, and smoothie buttons. These buttons are preprogrammed with varying speeds\u2014alternating pulsing and blending\u2014to move ingredients through the jug, so you don\u2019t have to move ingredients around manually. Versatile functionality The Hemisphere Control combines the functionality of a powerful blender with some food processing tasks. It crushes and chops to turn ice into snow for velvety cocktails and also folds and aerates for creamy smoothies and soups. In addition, thanks to its innovative blade design and high torque motor, the Hemisphere Control can handle blending tasks more efficiently and with less noise.  Designed with the consumer in mind  The Hemisphere Control blender is both easy to use and easy to clean. An LCD timer, 5 different speeds and three additional task functions make creating the perfect blend as easy as pushing one button. The permanent blade system is a snap to clean: just put in a drop of detergent and blend with water to remove food remnants, and then put the entire jug in the dishwasher. In addition, it is constructed from the highest quality materials. Heavy duty blades are made of engineered surgical grade stainless steel that ensures the blades stay sharp for longer, while the sturdy base is made from die-cast stainless steel.  Product Features  Breville Assist lid: ring pull lid for easy removal Large 48 oz. (1.5L) Eastman Tritan copolyester jug with a 6-cup capacity: has unique dual ribs that continually pass ingredients onto the blades for well blended results, dishwasher safe Permanent Hemisphere Blade and Bowl System, made with engineering grade surgical grades stainless steel: revolutionary blade technology for 100% perfect blending and food processing results User-friendly controls  LCD Timer: counts up and down for pre-programmed settings Pre-programmed Ice Crush and Smoothie Settings: automatically alter speeds to improve blending results Illuminated buttons: for clarity and ease of reading Electronic 5 speed control: plus PULSE ensure the RPM speed is maintained for consistent results every time  Heavy duty die-cast metal base for long lasting, professional performance Heavy duty 750W motor Easy cord storage: the cord coils around the base of the blender ", "salesrank_2018": "6020"}, "B005IA859U": {"description": "SpiceStor Organizer is an easy and cost effective way to efficiently store and quickly access your spices in your kitchen cabinets, on pantry shelves or in deep drawers.

The waterproof 233-thread count 80-percent poly/20-percent cotton dobby stripe decorative shell is incredibly soft and soothing. A special TPU Laminate waterproof barrier and Stain Repellent Scotchgard Finish protects against spills and accidents of all types, but that's just a couple of the wonderful features of this pad. Constructed within the pad is the patented Safe and Warm low-voltage technology. This low-voltage mattress pad includes a small power supply box that changes 120-volt AC home current into non-hazardous low-voltage DC current (very similar to a battery) to provide warmth, protection and safety even if the pad becomes wet. Unlike other warming pads with their thick bulky wires, the wires in the Serta pads are so small and thin; they are virtually unnoticeable. During construction we place the thin wires 3-inch apart and evenly distribute them from head to toe. The benefit to you is a pad that gives more of an even heat and has no annoying hot or cold spots. The twin size pad comes standard with one easy to read, easy to turn, non-slip computerized controller to adjust the temperature of the pad. A giant backlit display with auto dimming feature provides more convenience for night time adjustments with out having to turn on the lights. For cozy sheets before bed time, it has an automatic pre-heat and hold feature. You simply turn it on and the pad will warm up on HI until it reaches the temperature that you pre set your dial on and then adjusts itself to hold it there. For your safety, convenience and power conservation it has an automatic shut off feature that will shut the pad off after 10-hour just in case you forget. It also comes standard with built in over temperature protection for that extra bit of safety and peace of mind. A fitted skirt keeps it all in place to eliminate shifting or bunching and gives better sheet fit. The label on the product does not state waterproof but the item is waterproof.This warming product has been designed to provide you a gentle relaxing heat.

Creating the perfect cup is something special to be savored. Something delightfully indulgent and memorable, something that evokes every sentiment of an authentic European caf\u00e9. That\u2019s the promise of Melitta. Intelligent design, detailed craftsmanship, full-bodied flavor and a sensuous experience in every sip.  Product Feature Benefits 10 cup vacuum-sealed, thermal carafe with thumb-activated pouring (no need to twist the lid)Choose among regular, bold and robust settings for complete control over your coffee\u2019s tasteCone-shaped filter basket swings out for easy access and offers optimal coffee extraction Programmable to let you brew coffee automatically in the morning  Pause & serve feature lets you pour a cup before coffee is finished brewing Dimensions: 9.5\u201dW \u2013 12\u201dD \u2013 11.5\u201dH     Take the next step in your pursuit of the perfect cup The 10 cup Melitta Brewer brews with a drip machine that brews into a cone-shaped filter for better extraction and offers you control over the strength of your coffee. The Melitta Coffee Brewer knows how to make the most of your favorite ground coffee, from brewing it at a hot temperature to offering you the ability to wake up to a hot pot of coffee that\u2019s ready to pour. If you\u2019re dedicated to great-tasting coffee, choose the Melitta model with the carafe that fits your needs best: traditional glass with an adjustable-temperature heating plate or a thermal version that holds in heat without the need for a heating plate. See for yourself what coffee lovers are saying about the noticeable improvement in their coffee enjoyment experience. Melitta will bring hundreds of years of European culture, refined craftsmanship and rich indulgence to life, right inside your cup. Choosing Your Brewing Strength: Melitta Coffee Brewers offer the choice of regular, bold and robust brewing strengths. It\u2019s not difficult to decide which setting is right for you. If you typically purchase coffee described as, \u201cbright, breakfast blend or mildly flavored,\u201d and are not fond of espresso, your taste buds will be more at home with the REGULAR setting. If, on the other hand, you are drawn to dark, oily coffee beans at the store and look for coffee adjectives such as \u201cbold, deep or rich,\u201d choose the BOLD or ROBUST brewing setting. Making Iced Coffee In addition to brewing hot coffee, the Melitta 10 Cup Thermal Coffee Brewer is perfect for making iced coffee. Try some the next time you need a refreshing pick-me-up on a hot day or to energize yourself before a project. To make iced coffee, fill the reservoir with water to the 5-cup mark and fill the thermal carafe with ice to just below the rim. After that, simply brew double-strength coffee. After brewing, pour the iced coffee into a glass filled with ice and add your favorite sweetener or cream. Care and Cleaning: Regular cleaning of the Melitta Coffee Brewer will help extend its life by removing hard water deposits that may be present in the tap water. You can choose to clean your brewer with inexpensive vinegar or purchase a coffee machine cleaner. Cleaning the coffee brewer regularly may seem like extra work, but you\u2019ll find that the improvement in taste is well worth it.

The smooth, uniform cuts will help you make every meal a work of art. With the 4\" Swiss Classic Paring Knife you can expertly remove pepper seeds, core an apple, trim beans, and devein shrimp with ease.   A versatile paring knife is an essential tool in every kitchen. Like the chef's knife, a paring knife is meant to be used for a wide array of jobs; however, the first and foremost function of a paring knife is detail work and greater control. Its slightly curved blade and pointed tip even resemble a chef's knife, but, is a fraction of the size, which makes it great for small, precision cuts where control is essential. The 4\" blade length, slightly longer than the standard 3 1/4\" parer, offers additional strength when slicing and dicing fruits and vegetables. The pointed tip allows you to make intricate cuts or check the tenderness of meat and vegetables. With increased maneuverability and dexterity, you'll find endless opportunities to utilize this nimble knife.   Featuring a world-renowned blade and perfect balance, the 4\" Swiss Classic Paring Knife provides a professional-grade tool optimized for home use.

The Victorinox Swiss Army Swiss Classic collection offers a contemporary handle, inspired by our patented Fibrox Pro line. Designed to minimize wrist tension while providing a secure grip, the contoured nylon handle is both lightweight and durable, making these knives seem less likes tools and more like an extension of your hand.   Whether a seasoned, or novice home chef, Victorinox Swiss Army offers not only the right tools and the know-how, but most importantly, the confidence to achieve one\u2019s culinary aspirations. Expertly crafted in Switzerland since 1884, Victorinox offers a lifetime guarantee against defects in material and workmanship.   Formerly Forschner In 1937 Victorinox began selling cutlery in America through a Connecticut distributor called R.H. Forschner & Co. A well-known manufacturer of butcher scales, Forschner soon became the exclusive U.S. distributor for Victorinox knives, and was the name by which Victorinox knives were known.   In 2011 Victorinox began marketing all its product lines, including kitchen knives, under the common umbrella name by which the company is now popularly known \u2013 Victorinox Swiss Army.   Care and Use Be good to your knives and they\u2019ll be good to you. Following these simple guidelines will ensure that you get the longest life out of your knife!   Hand Washing Victorinox Swiss Army recommends washing all knives by hand. For best results, hand wash your knives with a soapy cloth and dry immediately.   Dishwasher While Swiss Classic knives are dishwasher safe, we recommend hand washing as dishwashers are designed to spray water at a relatively high pressure, which can jostle the silverware and cause the knives to collide, dulling the edge.   Maintaining your Knife\u2019s Edge For optimum performance, knives should be honed after every couple of uses. Proper and frequent use of a honing steel will keep your knives sharper and performing at their best, but remember that a honing steel will not sharpen a dull knife. Honing steels are maintenance tools and are used to help keep an already sharp blade from degrading. During use, a knife edge becomes rolled or turned from direct contact with cutting boards, bones or other hard objects. In this case, honing is necessary to straighten the edge of the knife. After significant use, the steel particles become damaged and the edge cannot be brought back by honing, so sharpening is necessary. If your knives are dull, pitted, or you see visible nicks on the cutting edge, you\u2019ll need to sharpen with a Swiss Sharp Handheld Sharpener (49002) or bring to a professional for re-sharpening.   History and Heritage In 1884, Master Cutler Karl Elsener opened a cutlery shop in Ibach, Switzerland. There, he and the cutlers\u2019 union he formed produced the finest steel cutlery, finished with the now-famous proprietary edge preferred globally by professional and home cooks. In 1891, Karl supplied the Swiss Army with its standard issue Soldier\u2019s Knife and in 1897 with the Officer\u2019s Knife. In 1921, after the death of his mother, Victoria, and with the advent of stainless steel, then known as \u201cinoxydable\u201d and used in the production of his cutlery, Karl changed the name of the company to Victorinox. It is from those humble beginnings that a worldwide icon was born.   Today, Victorinox is still owned and operated by the Elsener family, and both the company and family still resides in the small village of Ibach, Switzerland.\"", "salesrank_2018": "6598"}, "B005LRYP2Q": {"description": "   The new Swiss Classic collection  Victorinox Swiss Army has been making legendary Swiss Army Knives since 1897. Guess what we made before that. When Karl Elsener created the first Swiss Army Knife, he had no idea that he had just invented the symbol of Swiss ingenuity for generations to come. As a Master Cutler, he was only doing what came naturally. Karl had opened his cutlery factory 13 years before in Ibach, a village in northern Switzerland. By the time he dreamed up the world's first pocket tool, his cutlery business was already booming. As it was then, Cutlery by Victorinox Swiss Army is today the first choice of professionals right down the line - as ubiquitous in the bustling meat-packing plants of the Midwest as it is in the gleaming, four-star restaurant kitchens of Midtown Manhattan.

Measure It Your Way When you measure out a small amount of an ingredient, it's annoying if your scale only reads pounds. Or if you're weighing a large quantity, a readout in ounces is useless. That's why this scale gives you both unit options, as well as grams and kilograms. It will remember your last unit selection, so there's no need to reset it every time. Exceptional Capacity and Precision The Epica measures up to 11 lbs. (5 kg), much more useful than the average kitchen scale that stops at 5 lbs. The readout is in decimal points, such as 00.000 lbs., a great help if you're using a calculator to divide a recipe. And it's precise down to .05 oz. (1 g), essential for accurate portion control. Tare Function Calculates Net Weight of Food Use the tare button to weigh the empty container and factor out that amount from the final readout. In a hurry? The Epica even lets you skip this step. With the scale turned off, place the empty container on it, and press the on button. Now add the food and get an instant reading. Convenient to Use The extra large LCD display gives you a fast, easy-to-read weight, and saves the batteries by automatically shutting off after three minutes. A stable weighing platform and five nonslip rubber feet keep everything safe and secure.

Once the rice has fully cooked, the unit automatically switches over to keep-warm mode (140 to 175 degrees F), which maintains an ideal serving temperature without drying-out or over-cooking the rice. The rice cooker's inner pot features a nonstick coating, which means rice won't stick to the sides or bottom, making it possible to gracefully transfer the cooked rice to a serving dish or dinner plate. For added convenience, the rice cooker makes it easy to reheat cold rice. Just add 1/4 cup of cold water per cup of cooked rice, stir to mix, and then press the \"on\" switch to start cooking. Once the rice has heated, the rice cooker will automatically switch to the keep-warm function. Saute/Browning Function In addition to cooking healthy, delicious rice to restaurant-quality perfection, the versatile cooker--with the simple press of a button--allows for sauteing onions, garlic, and vegetables or browning meats and other ingredients prior to cooking. The saute function is optional and not required for cooking rice or other meals, but it offers greater versatility when preparing favorite recipes--no need to dirty a second pan.   Measuring cup and ladle included. View larger.  User-Friendly Design Other thoughtful details include stay-cool side handles and a loop lid handle for safe transport and lid removal, a sleek-looking modern design with a small footprint, and helpful indicator lights that make it easy to check the cooking cycle at a glance: red for saute mode, amber for cooking mode, and green for keep-warm mode. Even more, the rice cooker's nonstick removable inner pot lifts out for quick cleanup by hand or in the dishwasher, and a 5.33-ounce measuring cup and a ladle come included, as well as a user's manual with delicioius recipes ranging from rice with chicken to sweet rice pudding sprinkled with cinnamon.

Neodymium magnets are a member of the Rare Earth magnet family and are the most powerful permanent magnets in the world. Unlike most other types of magnets, they will NOT lose their magnetization over time, around other magnets, or if they are dropped.\nThe material ABS was chosen for the making of the hard casing of The Fast Draw Gun Magnet for its incredible strength, durability and longevity. It offers such advantages as being dent proof, rust proof and erosion proof. It is virtually indestructible, yet it will not harm your gun's finish.\n\nThe dimensional footprint of the Fast Draw Gun Magnet is 2.75\" X 1.5\" as was found to be the most accommodating, and would fit most areas that you may need to mount or hide your Fast Draw Gun Magnet. The depth size of .70\" was also intentional. The Fast Draw Gun Magnet, because of it thicker depth, will accommodate larger guns with much larger sights. We also incorporated industrial strength molded mounting points into the body of the casing to add even more strength. We did not drill into the body of the casing or use rivets that rust, or grommets that cause your magnet to wobble or become unstable.  We engineered a product specific, \"flush mount placement, push-locking system\" to keep our powerful magnet securely inside the casing.\n \nNo other gun magnet manufacturer in the world has focused as much attention to detail and design of their product as we have for our Fast Draw Gun Magnets.\n\nThis is a NEW unused Fast Draw Gun Magnet (TM).\n\nIf you have any questions you may contact us through Amazon.\n\nRemember: You are buying from us direct.

Now lodge has added a new line of seasoned steel skillets. This handy 10-inch seasoned steel skillet is the only pre-seasoned and ready to use out of the box steel pan in the market place right now. Each skillet is pre-seasoned with natural soy bean oil. Maintains very low and very high temperatures, making the pan a highly effective and versatile cooking piece. It performs well in residential and professional kitchens as well as outdoors. Made of 12 gauge carbon steel. Steel is a high density metal that does not retain odors. If maintained correctly, it will last a lifetime. Thickness of the cooking surface allows the pan to heat up quickly but also retain the heat needed for even cooking. The handle angle is conducive for both stove top and oven cooking. Each handle is attached to the skillet with 3 secure rivets. As a result of the pre-seasoning process, you may see a blister or bubble of oil at the southern-most point or at the end of the handle of the cookware piece. The cookware is hanging as it rides through the electrostatic sprayer and commercial conveyer ovens at very high temperatures. This allows the oil to penetrate deeply into the pores of the cookware which creates an easy release finish. If visible, it will rub or flake off with your finger, leaving a brown spot. Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not rust but a seasoned spot that is brown, indicative of the varnish stage of seasoning. The brown spot will turn black with use.

But that saying came from Scotland, where \"room temperature\" is cooler than it is in more temperate zones. In places like the United States, whisky is often served too warm. But ice cubes make it too cold , which also kills the flavor. Connoisseurs prefer Epica Whiskey Chilling Rocks because they chill whisky to the ideal sipping temperature.\n\nSafe and Attractive Soapstone\n\n\n\nThis natural stone, designated safe (GRAS) by the FDA, is nonporous and won't react with alcohol or water or other drinks. It has no taste or odor to affect the drink's flavor, unlike those plastic ice cubes. Its elegant good looks complement sophisticated occasions better than plastic as well. Soapstone has more thermal mass than such stones as granite, allowing it to retain its chill longer. It's also softer and lightweight to prevent scratching glassware.\n\n\n\nEpica Whisky Chilling Rocks are handcrafted in 3/4\" (2 cm) cubes -- small enough to fit most glasses but not so small that they'll slide around and splash.\n\n\nHow to Use Epica Whisky Chilling Rocks\n\n\nFreeze the stones for at least 4 hours before use. Put 3 stones in an empty glass in a single layer and pour in whisky or other spirit to the height of 1 stone (about 2 fl. oz.). Wait 5 minutes and enjoy. When the party's over, rinse and air dry, put them in their pouch and store in the freezer.\n\n\n\nWhisky Chilling Rocks won't chill large volumes of liquid. Do not chew or ingest them.

This inexpensive heater from SUNHEAT offers affordability and comfort to slash your heating costs.  The infrared heater was first developed and sold in the early 1980's using four flood lamps and a flat piece of sheet metal as the heat sink. SUNHEAT International distributed this USA made product for many years before the manufacturer sold out. The mass marketing company, now selling the self proclaimed famous infrared heater, immediately started having a plastic product built overseas. SUNHEAT International started designing the SH-1500 soon after and sold its first to the public in January 2006.  The Thermal Wave was given birth, from the Original SUNHEAT SH-1500, in 2011 by the family owned and operated Nebraska SUNHEAT Team as a counter to lower priced (and quality) competition. The new 2012 design houses a heavier duty cord than its predecessor and has revamped its look with a more contemporary color. The remote control was added and you can also use the screen to adjust the temperature and timer. In the price point game, SUNHEAT has emerged once again as the clear-cut top quality infrared heater in the under $200 category.

Equipped with 12 amps of power, this upright bagged vacuum is able to clean your home thoroughly. The AirSpeed vacuum has several features that make it a cool and hygienic choice for cleaning. Built with a two tube system, the AirSpeed allows more air to enter the vacuum cleaner.   Moves More Air. Removes More Dirt Installed with a Bag Change Indicator, the Eureka AirSpeed upright vacuum tells you when you need to replace the vacuum bag. An orange light indicates that the bag is full and needs replacement. Changing the vacuum bag is a mess free process. Remove the Filtrete bag by just opening the Quick Clean Lock bag changing system.  Ideal for people who need to clean up after pets. Its 14 inch wide cleaning path allows it to access hard to reach areas and better coverage of the carpets around your home. The clear view brush roll window allows you to see the brush roll action and also notice if anything gets tangled in the brush while cleaning. The suction control switch allows you to choose from where you want maximum suction, on the floor or the hose. The Pet Power Paw tool Pet Power Paw removes pet hair from carpet & upholster. Its plastic teeth loosen it, rubber strip grabs it and bristles remove it.  AirSpeed Technology The key to the cleaning power of AirSpeed lies in its AirSpeed Technology. Unlike most other vacuums with a typically winding hose, AirSpeed Technology has two smooth tubes, featuring limited bends and turns. This allows more air to pass through the vacuum and offers a powerful, deep clean that removes more than just the dirt you can see. The direct air path from floor to cup decreases the distance for dirt to travel, which increases the amount of airflow for powerful suction. Whirlwind Cyclonic Technology Eureka\u2019s Whirlwind Cyclonic Technology offers maintained suction power and less maintenance** by separating larger debris from fine dust once the dirt is delivered to the dust cup.  Other features include a HEPA filter which reduces dust, dirt and allergens and a 27 feet long cord which allows you to clean around the house without having to change outlet points. It weighs 18.5 pounds and measures 15\"W x 12\"L x 44\"H. It is backed by a 3 year limited warranty. Getting the Best Results \u2022 Moving brush roll, power switch should be in suction only position when using hose.  \u2022 Do not use the cleaner without the filter and bag properly installed. This can damage the cleaner.  \u2022 Some fine particles can restrict airflow very quickly and will decrease performance even before the dust container appears full. For that reason, when vacuuming carpet fresheners or cleaners, powder, plaster dust or similar fine substances, the dust cup and filter may need cleaning more often.  \u2022 Use the cleaner to pick up dirt and dust particles. Avoid picking up hard or sharp objects that could damage the vacuum cleaner.  \u2022 To avoid unnecessary service calls, check the hose, dust cup and motor filter often. Clear a clogged hose, empty the bag if it is full, and clean the motor filter when it is dirty.     Two smooth tubes featuring limited bends and turns allowing more air to pass through  14\u201d Wide Cleaning Path Allows this vacuum to clean floors faster with an extra wide cleaning path for greater floor coverage.     Bag Change Indicator  Lets you know when the bag is ready to be changed. Changing bags regularly, as needed, will help maintain optimum performance.     Clear View Brush Roll Window The clear view brush roll window allows you to see the brushroll in action on carpeted surfaces     Deep Cleaning Performance This deep cleaning vacuum removes more than just the dirt you are able to see   Extend your cleaning reach with the 12 feet hose and wand and 30 feet long cord  Pet Power Paw Pet Power Paw removes pet hair from carpet and upholstery.

They\u2019re restored to a fully functional condition. In short, they are everything a Dyson machine should be- they work properly and don\u2019t lose suction. Dyson refurbishes vacuums that are returned to us by retailers or consumers.  Refurbishing these machines, rather than disposing of them, means that the parts and materials are re-used instead of wasted.   When a machine comes to us to be refurbished, it is first stripped down as far as necessary. Components removed from the machine that meet our high standards of quality are kept and cleaned. Most damaged or broken components are sent away for recycling. The core of the machine is thoroughly cleaned and new parts are added to replace damaged or cosmetically unacceptable parts discovered during the stripping down process.   Just like our brand new machines, the rebuilt machine then undergoes a comprehensive series of electrical and performance tests to ensure that it works as it should. For our vacuums, one of the tests carried out is a suction test. All refurbished vacuums are electrically tested in compliance with electrical and safety requirements. One of the primary differences between a new Dyson machine and a refurbished Dyson machine is its appearance\u2013 a scratch here or there or a slightly clouded bin may provide a clue that it has been previously used. After it has passed all of the tests, the machine is then packaged and sent out.  All Dyson refurbished vacuums come with a 6 month parts and labor warranty.  The Dyson DC28 Animal is a powerful, wheeled vacuum cleaner featuring Airmuscle\u2122 and Root Cyclone\u2122 technology.  Designed for homes with pets, DC28 Animal delivers powerful pet hair pickup.

DC28 Animal is designed for all floor types, and with fingertip controls, you can automatically adjust, (or deactivate), the brush bar for different floor types using a powered cam.   The clear bin, made of tough polycarbonate, lets you see when it needs emptying.  The bin is also hygienic and quick to empty, which allows for minimal contact with dirt.  DC28 Animal features an ergonomic carrying handle, designed and positioned for comfortable carrying.  As with all Dyson vacuum cleaners, the DC28 Animal has no loss of suction.

According to studies by the USDA, eating more fruits and vegetables reduces your risk of chronic diseases like heart attacks and strokes, some cancers, heart disease, obesity, and type 2 diabetes, in addition to acute ailments like kidney stones and high blood pressure. With the Big Mouth Pro Juice Extractor, kick-starting and maintaining a healthy lifestyle couldn't be simpler. In just one 6 to 10-oz. serving (175-300 ml), fresh juice can fulfill the recommended daily value of Vitamin A and D, calcium, potassium, protein and fiber. And the Big Mouth Pro Juice Extractor is able to do that without the need for sugar, preservatives or additives.  Freshly Prepared Juice Ranks High A glass of fresh, natural juice is an excellent, healthy way to begin your morning routine, break up your day or inject some serious energy into a lazy afternoon. With the Big Mouth Pro Juice Extractor, there's lots of versatile options for juicing, so you can enjoy the invigorating taste of the very freshest juice, any time of the day.  Variety is Key In addition to its speed and durability, the Big Mouth Pro Juice Extractor comes with healthy recipes and suggestions for adding more vegetables to your day and \"smart shopping\" for the flavor and the season. Try out one of these healthy, delicious recipes to taste the difference in freshness:  THE GO-GETTER 4 medium kale leaves2 medium carrots, trimmed1 cup baby spinach leaves1 Granny Smith apple, quartered1/2 lemon, peeled1-inch piece fresh ginger, peeled Juice all ingredients in order listed.

Stir well and serve. Makes 1 serving  Alternative Uses  Not sure what to do with the leftover pulp? The leftover pulp is mostly fiber and cellulose, which like the juice, contains necessary vital nutrients for the daily diet. Any leftover pulp can be used in a variety of recipes, frothy drinks, casseroles or soups, as well as for garden composting.  Thirsty for something other than juice? The Big Mouth Pro Juice Extractor can help children, teens and adults get their daily vitamin intake with the option of making soy, almond or rice milk. To start, soak one cup of soybeans, almonds or rice in four cups of water for 24 to 48 hours in the refrigerator, and then slowly pour one cup into the food chute. The liquid extracted from the soaked mixture is the \"milk.\" For enhanced milk flavor, consider adding vanilla or honey.  Easy Cleaning, More Enjoying Ease of cleaning is particularly important, because as with any small kitchen appliance, you will naturally use it more frequently if you can anticipate a hassle-free cleanup. With the Big Mouth Pro Juice Extractor, all parts \u2013 except for the motor base \u2013 are dishwasher safe. Here are some more easy-to-follow tips for effortless cleanup:  Place a plastic grocery bag in the pulp bin container to collect the pulp and once juicing is complete, simply discard. When you're done juicing, pass the strainer basket under running water and brush off excess fiber buildup or pulp with included cleaning brush.  TIPS & CARE  Some extractors yield more juice than others, and the proportion of pulp to juice varies from fruit to fruit. Most fruits and vegetables such as apples, carrots and cucumbers will not need to be pre-cut into smaller pieces since they are likely to fit into the extra-wide feed chute. However, it is recommended that oranges, pineapples, melons and mangoes be peeled before placing in the unit to minimize impact on juice flavor. Also, all fruits with pits and large seeds, such as nectarines, peaches, apricots, plums and cherries MUST be pitted before juicing. To extract the maximum amount of juice every time, gently guide food down the feed chute slowly so that juice doesn't spray out of the spout. Do not allow pulp container to overfill, as this may prevent correct operation or damage to the unit.

Designed exclusively for hard surface floors, Mint Plus sweeps and mops using dry and pre-moistened cleaning cloths.  With features like the Pro-Clean Reservoir Pad and expanded cleaning area, Mint Plus can mop further and better than ever before. And with faster charging and longer run time, Mint Plus can cover more ground more often for everyday clean floors.  Guided by the enhanced NorthStar\u00ae Navigation System 2.0, Mint Plus cleans methodically by moving back and forth across open areas in straight lines, working around furniture and rugs, and cleaning along baseboards. Mint Plus\u2019s compact design gets into tight spaces, under furniture and into other areas that are hard to reach with traditional mops and sweepers.  Mint Plus is easy to use. Simply attach your cleaning cloth of choice, choose sweep or mop and let Mint Plus clean for you. Since Mint Plus is not a vacuum, it operates quietly so you \u2013 and your pets \u2013 won't be disturbed while it cleans.  NorthStar Navigation The NorthStar Navigation System works like an indoor GPS that helps Mint keep track of where it has been and where it needs to go. Specifically, the NorthStar Cube projects a signal that Mint uses to determine its location. Then as Mint starts cleaning, it builds a map of the area as it goes, marking walls, obstacles and drop offs as it encounters them.  Using the NorthStar Cube as a reference point, Mint can map and clean up to 800 square feet either in a large open space or by discovering adjacent rooms. In mop mode, the cleaning area is restricted to optimize cleaning while the cloth is wet.   Cleaning Cycle Mint starts by cleaning open areas, moving methodically back and forth across the floor in parallel lines. As Mint encounters obstacles, it decides how to handle them \u2013 either cleaning around them and then continuing on its path or turning around, saving the area ahead for later. Periodically, Mint will return to these spots and clean them before moving on to an entirely new area.  Once Mint completes open areas, it follows with a perimeter sweep along the edges of furniture and walls for a complete clean.  When Mint is finished cleaning, it returns to where it started and parks itself so you know right where to find it.  Cube-to-Cube Cleaning  New with NorthStar2, Mint Plus can travel from one Cube to another to expand its dry sweeping area up to 2,000 square feet in a single cleaning cycle. Set up is easy. Simply place a Cube in the first area you\u2019d like to clean and set additional Cubes set to different channels in other rooms or areas you\u2019d like Mint Plus to reach. As Mint Plus encounters each new Cube it will lock on and keep building its map while it cleans.  Only on Mint Plus- Additional Cubes for Mint 4200 can be used to set up different cleaning areas in the home without having to move the Cube from place to place, but Mint 4200 cannot clean from one Cube to another automatically. Pause / Resume   New with NorthStar2, the cleaning cycle can be paused to change the cleaning cloth by pressing any button or simply picking Mint Plus up by its handle while it is cleaning. The map of area covered is retained while paused so when Mint Plus resumes cleaning it can continue cleaning areas not yet covered. Only on Mint Plus.  Quick Clean Mode   Mint Plus can be set to clean only open areas and not perform a perimeter clean so you can cover more ground more quickly. Only on Mint Plus.  Pro-Clean Reservoir Pad  The Pro-Clean Reservoir Pad dispenses liquid throughout the cleaning cycle, continually refreshing the Pro-Clean microfiber cloth with fresh fluid. The fluid reserve keeps the cloth damp so Mint Plus can mop up to 350 square feet in a single cleaning cycle.

The gold foil used in the production of these filters is scientifically engineered and is amazingly sturdy to provide years of service.

The 8\" Swiss Classic Chef\u2019s Knife can handle nearly every kitchen task imaginable, with its incredibly sharp edge and textured, ergonomic handle, each cut is like slicing through butter. \u201cRecommended\u201d by a leading gourmet consumer magazine that features unbiased ratings and reviews of cookware and kitchen equipment, this Chef's Knife is preferred due to its razor sharp edge that rarely requires re-sharpening.   We\u2019ve selected the best attributes derived from our rich commercial heritage and modified them to suit the home chef. The Victorinox Swiss Army Swiss Classic collection offers a contemporary handle, inspired by our patented Fibrox Pro line. Designed to minimize wrist tension while providing a secure grip, the contoured nylon handle is both lightweight and durable, making these knives seem less likes tools and more like an extension of your hand.   Offering perfect balance and featuring the same world-renowned blade as found on our Fibrox Pro line, the 8\" Swiss Classic Chef\u2019s Knife provides a professional-grade tool optimized for home use. The tapered knife edge is ground in two directions to hold a sharp edge longer, and can easily be brought back to its original sharpness.   An all-purpose chef's knife is an essential tool in every kitchen. The 8\" Swiss Classic Chef\u2019s Knife is optimally weighted with high-quality, lightweight European steel that reduces hand and wrist fatigue, making it comfortable even after extended use in the home kitchen. Perfectly suited for dicing onions, mincing shallots, chopping herbs, crushing garlic, slicing meats of all varieties, and shredding cabbage, its versatility will quickly make it your go-to knife.   At 8 inches, this knife offers the heft needed to complete larger tasks effortlessly, while still allowing for perfect maneuverability on smaller tasks that a larger, bulkier knife may not be able to accomplish as easily. The overall shape of the blade, with a long, sloping curve, lends itself to \u201crocking\u201d very well, allowing one to mince and chop with ease, while the flat spine allows you to comfortably press down on the blade when extra power is needed to slice through hard-skinned items like acorn, or butternut squash.   Whether a seasoned, or novice home chef, Victorinox Swiss Army offers not only the right tools and the know-how, but most importantly, the confidence to achieve one\u2019s culinary aspirations. Expertly crafted in Switzerland since 1884, Victorinox offers a lifetime guarantee against defects in material and workmanship.   Please NOTE that this item ships with the International item number 6.8063.20 on the blade and not 6.8063.20US1, but is the same 8\" Swiss Classic Chef's Knife.   Formerly Forschner In 1937 Victorinox began selling cutlery in America through a Connecticut distributor called R.H. Forschner & Co. A well-known manufacturer of butcher scales, Forschner soon became the exclusive U.S. distributor for Victorinox knives, and was the name by which Victorinox knives were known.   In 2011 Victorinox began marketing all its product lines, including kitchen knives, under the common umbrella name by which the company is now popularly known \u2013 Victorinox Swiss Army.   Care and Use Be good to your knives and they\u2019ll be good to you. Following these simple guidelines will ensure that you get the longest life out of your knife!   Hand Washing Victorinox Swiss Army recommends washing all knives by hand. For best results, hand wash your knives with a soapy cloth and dry immediately.   Dishwasher While Swiss Classic knives are dishwasher safe, we recommend hand washing as dishwashers are designed to spray water at a relatively high pressure, which can jostle the silverware and cause the knives to collide, dulling the edge.   Maintaining your Knife\u2019s Edge For optimum performance, knives should be honed after every couple of uses. Proper and frequent use of a honing steel will keep your knives sharper and performing at their best, but remember that a honing steel will not sharpen a dull knife. Honing steels are maintenance tools and are used to help keep an already sharp blade from degrading. During use, a knife edge becomes rolled or turned from direct contact with cutting boards, bones or other hard objects. In this case, honing is necessary to straighten the edge of the knife. After significant use, the steel particles become damaged and the edge cannot be brought back by honing, so sharpening is necessary. If your knives are dull, pitted, or you see visible nicks on the cutting edge, you\u2019ll need to sharpen with a Swiss Sharp Handheld Sharpener (49002) or bring to a professional for re-sharpening.   History and Heritage In 1884, Master Cutler Karl Elsener opened a cutlery shop in Ibach, Switzerland. There, he and the cutlers\u2019 union he formed produced the finest steel cutlery, finished with the now-famous proprietary edge preferred globally by professional and home cooks. In 1891, Karl supplied the Swiss Army with its standard issue Soldier\u2019s Knife and in 1897 with the Officer\u2019s Knife. In 1921, after the death of his mother, Victoria, and with the advent of stainless steel, then known as \u201cinoxydable\u201d and used in the production of his cutlery, Karl changed the name of the company to Victorinox. It is from those humble beginnings that a worldwide icon was born.   Today, Victorinox is still owned and operated by the Elsener family, and both the company and family still resides in the small village of Ibach, Switzerland.", "salesrank_2018": "13565"}, "B0061TWKTI": {"description": "Take a stroll to your local delicatessen...by walking into your kitchen!

Doubles Your Baking Options with Convection Technology A 9\"x13\" baking pan can be found in most kitchens in North America, used for making everything from lasagna to brownies. Not only does this oven fit two 9\"x13\" pans at once, unlike conventional ovens without convection technology, the Countertop Oven with Convection and Rotisserie comes fully equipped. Instead of having heat come from just one central area and no fan to \"stir-up\" or circulate air evenly all over, this oven's convection technology utilizes a top and bottom heating element and a built-in fan to distribute heat evenly for a uniform temperature. That way, bakers can choose between traditional baking \u2013 ideal for cupcakes, cakes and soft baked goods \u2013 or convection baking \u2013 ideal for a crispy pizzas, cookies or even taquitos. For light and fluffy soft baked goods like cupcakes, cakes or pastries, follow these BAKE directions. For crispier foods like pizzas or cookies, use CONVECTION BAKE, which forces more air to circulate in the oven, so foods will cook faster at the same oven temperature:  Before setting to BAKE or CONVECTION BAKE, place first baking rack in very bottom rack slot and second baking rack in the third rack slot from the bottom.Set the desired TEMPERATURE. Set FUNCTION to BAKE or CONVECTION BAKEPREHEAT: Rotate the Timer past 40 minutes, then to 5 minutes before baking.Using BAKE: After oven is preheated, rotate Timer past 40 minutes, then to desired baking time or rotate to STAY ON. Using CONVECTION BAKE: For baking pizza, check the pizza manufacturer's recommendations for reducing cooking time and temperature for best results.  For roasted chicken, beef roast or pork roast, follow these ROTISSERIE directions:  Before setting to ROTISSERIE, slide large coated baking pan in lowest rack position. Tie chicken and large pieces of meat tightly with cotton string to prevent meat from hitting baking pan. For further instructions, search World Wide Web on \"How to Truss a Chicken for Rotisserie.\"Insert Rotisserie rod lengthwise into center of meat, and insert rotisserie forks on rod lengthwise into lower bottom half of meat. Make sure meat is centered evenly between rotisserie rod and fork ends, and tighten screws on rotisserie forks.Manually insert pointed end of rod holding chicken into oven rotisserie insert, rotating the rod as needed to fit and then place square end of rod into slot in bracket on left side.Set TEMPERATURE to BROIL/ROTISSERIE.

Full-Performance Ovens Preferred Over Toaster Ovens  Significant numbers of American consumers use their toaster ovens for more than just toast, and many are also eating at home to save money, eat healthier and manage ingredients. Look no further, the Hamilton Beach Countertop Oven with Convection & Rotisserie combines all these features into one. With an extra-large capacity to fit an entire meal for a family of four, additional BROIL settings for the health-conscious and offering four ways to cook, this appliance satisfies the palate, the diet and the budget. Easy Cleanup The full-width crumb/drip tray slides out from the front, allowing easy washing. For the best oven performance, cleaning should be done regularly. Unplug first and allow oven to cool before interior and exterior cleaning. For interior cleaning: wipe oven walls, bottom tray and glass door with a damp, soapy cloth, but do not scratch or damage heating element tube. Repeat with a damp, clean cloth. All removable parts should be hand washed in warm, soapy water as well. For stubborn interior stains, use a plastic scouring pad. For exterior cleaning: wipe oven walls with a damp cloth, but do not use abrasive cleansers or metal scouring pads; this can scrape/scratch the surface.  TIPS & CARE  Before cooking with the oven, always PREHEAT for approximately 5 minutes. Check pan manufacturer's directions for oven-safe rating. Do not cover the crumb/drip tray or any part of the oven in aluminum foil (causes overheating); however, use of aluminum foil to partially cover casseroles or some foods is acceptable.

Tea people - it will hold 10 to 16 oz of Darjeeling and green teas. Coffeevac's have a unique patented vacuum closure system, our 2 way valve, allows the carbon dioxide from the beans to slowly escape, without letting oxygen in. Solid and tinted models protect light sensitive beans and tea leaves. Coffeevac's save you money and guarantee smooth rich coffee flavor. The multiuse 16 oz Coffevac can also be used for most dry & wet goods. Store conveniently on the countertop, in the pantry, the fridge or freezer. \u00a0 \u00a0 Is the Coffeevac patented system easy to use? How does it work? Yes - To open simply push the press button on the cap, and pull the cap off. To close, push the press button, no need to pump, push cap down onto the body and with this motion the cap volume of air is eliminated, creating a vacuum seal, it\u2019s that simple! Is this a vacuum sealed container? The United States patent office granted us a patent on a vacuum container \u2013 Our Vacs create a partial vacuum \u2013 The same volume of air as the cap is removed and for human purposes this is enough to keep most goods fresh and edible for long periods of time. For the engineers out there technically speaking there is no vacuum until the cap is pulled upward without pressing the button. Either way the Vacs will keep goods fresher for longer and prevent weevil & bug infestations. This reality is why globally we have sold over 10 million Vacs without advertising. No batteries or electricity required! Are the Vacs smell proof? The Coffeevac \u00a0patented system is able to preserve goods for 1 year and beyond by allowing products to breath and degas.\u00a0 Almost all food goods are smell proof inside the Vacs , however some products like freshly roasted coffee and medical herbs may degas, leaking there odor. Our 2 way valve allows gas build up to slowly escape \u2013 without letting oxygen in. This is one of the main reasons it can preserve goods for long periods of time. Note:\u00a0 Medical herbs that are sticky & smelly we recommend using a strong zip lock bag inside the Vac. This helps contain the smell and keeps the area clean where the body and the cap meet. This is essential to create a smell proof situation. The sticky resin often created by these products can compromise the open and close system, causing the caps to crack when opening and closing under such pressure of a glue like substance. Keep these areas free from resin buildup. Use a product like Grundge off. Thus maximizing the efficiency of use and longevity of the Vacs. Is it moisture and oxygen free? Yes the Tightvac patented system keeps moisture and oxygen out \u2013 these elements cannot enter the container unless you decide to take the cap off. Are the Vacs durable? How long will they last? Yes the Vacs are made with NSF & FDA approved PS # 6, this plastic is very strong. These days shipping methods are very rough, packages being thrown, automated systems dropping huge parcels on top of smaller ones. If your Vac arrives damaged please report this IMMEDIATELY UPON RECIEPT for a part or full replacement.\u00a0 My cap seems loose?  We offer 10 different sizes and 3 styles of Vacs \u2013 Solid \u2013 Clear and Tint. Often a Solid & Tint Vac will have a slightly looser fitting cap then a clear model. It is a misconception that a tighter fitting cap is working better or holding more of a seal.\u00a0 Loose caps function just as well and will tighten with time and use. How should I clean the Vacs? Hand wash only - Use mild or natural cleaners. Do not microwave or put in dishwasher. Always keep the interior of the cap and the top of the container clean. This will ensure easy open and closure. What does NSF International certified mean? Recognized by regulatory agencies at the local, state, federal and international level, NSF International certification demonstrates that a product complies with all standard requirements. NSF conducts yearly manufacturing facility audits and product testing to verify that the product continues to comply with the standards set by the FDA.

It's made of heavy-gauge PVC with electronically welded seams for lasting quality. Open the patented Giga valve to deflate the bed in no time! Simply roll it up, fold in the sides, and store compactly in the included matching duffel bag for portability and storage. Why buy this bed? AirTek Remote Controller The remote controller allows you to adjust the amount of air in the bed while laying on it. Adjust the comfort as you want it \u2013 ultra plush or more firm. Comfort Typical air beds have either an ibeam, coil beam or pillowtop construction. The ibeam have long tubes of air, the coil beams have pockets of air, as do the pillowtops. Each of these constructions tends to either have something pressing against your back or have you straddling long beams of air. The memory foam top on this bed eliminates all of that.

This 3\u00bc\" Swiss Classic Serrated Paring Knife with Spear Point is extremely sharp and ready for anything from slicing and dicing to peeling and garnishing. Excellent for tackling fruits and vegetables with softer skins, such as tomatoes and peaches, but it is also perfectly suited for tasks such as expertly removing pepper seeds, coring an apple, trimming beans, or deveining shrimp with ease. The uniform cuts will help you make every meal a work of art.A versatile paring knife is an essential tool in every kitchen. Like the chef's knife, a paring knife is meant to be used for a wide array of jobs; however, the first and foremost function of a paring knife is detail work and greater control. Its slightly curved blade and pointed tip even resemble a chef's knife, but, is a fraction of the size, which makes it great for small, precision cuts where control is essential. The sharp points of the serrated edge pierce into soft skinned fruits and veggies to maintain a strong hold, offering better control throughout slicing. The scallops between each point reduce friction, so each slice feels effortless and prevents the knife from squashing the tender interior of whatever you are slicing. The pointed tip allows you to make intricate cuts or check the tenderness of meat and vegetables. With increased maneuverability and dexterity, you'll find endless opportunities to utilize this nimble knife.Featuring a world-renowned blade and perfect balance, the 3\u00bc\" Swiss Classic Serrated Parer provides a professional-grade tool optimized for home use.

Designed to minimize wrist tension while providing a secure grip, the contoured nylon handle is both lightweight and durable.Whether a seasoned, or novice home chef, Victorinox Swiss Army offers not only the right tools and the know-how, but most importantly, the confidence to achieve one\u2019s culinary aspirations. Expertly crafted in Switzerland since 1884, Victorinox offers a lifetime guarantee against defects in material and workmanship.Formerly ForschnerIn 1937 Victorinox began selling cutlery in America through a Connecticut distributor called R.H. Forschner & Co. A well-known manufacturer of butcher scales, Forschner soon became the exclusive U.S. distributor for Victorinox knives, and was the name by which Victorinox knives were known.In 2011 Victorinox began marketing all its product lines, including kitchen knives, under the common umbrella name by which the company is now popularly known \u2013 Victorinox Swiss Army. Today, Victorinox Swiss Army still sells a handful of accessories, including the High Heat Turner line, under the Forschner name.Care and UseBe good to your knives and they\u2019ll be good to you. Following these simple guidelines will ensure that you get the longest life out of your knife!Hand WashingVictorinox Swiss Army recommends washing all knives by hand. For best results, hand wash your knives with a soapy cloth and dry immediately.DishwasherWhile Swiss Classic knives are dishwasher safe, we still recommend hand washing as dishwashers are designed to spray water at a relatively high pressure, which can jostle the silverware and cause the knives to collide, dulling the edge.Maintaining your Knife\u2019s EdgeFor optimum performance, knives should be honed after every couple of uses. Proper and frequent use of a honing steel will keep your knives sharper and performing at their best, but remember that a honing steel will not sharpen a dull knife. Honing steels are maintenance tools and are used to help keep an already sharp blade from degrading. During use, a knife edge becomes rolled or turned from direct contact with cutting boards, bones or other hard objects. In this case, honing is necessary to straighten the edge of the knife. After significant use, the steel particles become damaged and the edge cannot be brought back by honing, so sharpening is necessary. If your knives are dull, pitted, or you see visible nicks on the cutting edge, you\u2019ll need to sharpen with a Swiss Sharp Handheld Sharpener (49002) or bring to a professional for re-sharpening.History and HeritageIn 1884, Master Cutler Karl Elsener opened a cutlery shop in Ibach, Switzerland. There, he and the cutlers\u2019 union he formed produced the finest steel cutlery, finished with the now-famous proprietary edge preferred globally by professional and home cooks. In 1891, Karl supplied the Swiss Army with its standard issue Soldier\u2019s Knife and in 1897 with the Officer\u2019s Knife. In 1921, after the death of his mother, Victoria, and with the advent of stainless steel, then known as \u201cinoxydable\u201d and used in the production of his cutlery, Karl changed the name of the company to Victorinox. It is from those humble beginnings that a worldwide icon was born.Today, Victorinox is still owned and operated by the Elsener family, and both the company and family still resides in the small village of Ibach, Switzerland.", "salesrank_2018": "9102"}, "B0067X12EW": {"description": "The Sharp Plasmacluster\u2122 Ion Air Purifier with True HEPA Filter effectively reduces pollen, dust, pet dander, smoke, germs, bacteria, viruses, odors, mold, and fungus in your living space.

A quality mill with a specifically designed grinding mechanism will release the aromas and essential oils of that spice. Freshly ground pepper and spices have more aroma and better flavor than pre- ground. Another advantage of using freshly ground spices or minerals (salts) is the control a mill provides for determining the coarseness (size) of a grind. A high quality pepper, salt or spice mill gives you the ability to choose and change the coarseness according to taste or necessity.  How to Choose a Good Mill When looking for a pepper, salt or spice grinder, consider the following: Grinding mechanism: Choose a grinding mechanism that can withstand daily use: one that is well made and produces a consistent grind. Ideally, the grinding mechanism should be designed to handle a specific spice, as each spice has different physical characteristics that will benefit from different design features.  Design and appearance: Whether it's traditional or modern, manual or electric, a mill can be an indispensable tool in your kitchen and a beautiful part of table decor.  Ease of Use: A quality mill should be easy to adjust, easy to fill, and feel comfortable in the hand.  History of Peugeot Peugeot's story starts in the 19th century when the Peugeot brothers converted the family's gristmill into a steel foundry. They began producing award winning hand tools immediately after opening and went on to produce a diverse range of exceptional quality products including small appliances, bicycles and most notably, automobiles. (Although now operating as a separate company, the Peugeot car company continues the same commitment to quality and innovation that is a Peugeot hallmark). In 1840 Peugeot created their burr style coffee grinder and adopted that design to accommodate peppercorns in 1874. The resulting pepper mechanism design is still used today in every Peugeot pepper mill. Peugeot's iconic pepper grinding mechanism design is often copied, but never equaled. Today, Peugeot offers six unique spice-specific mechanisms plus the original burr-style coffee grinder. There are no shortcuts: each mechanism is designed to get the most out of the spices they are intended for. After more than 160 years, Peugeot mills and grinders remain the benchmark of the industry and have earned their position as the mill of choice in world class kitchens. It's All About the Mechanism  The primary difference between Peugeot and all other brands are the spice-specific mechanisms. Peugeot has 7 unique spice specific mechanisms for pepper, salt, herbs and spices, coffee, wet salt, chili peppers and nutmeg. For each spice, there is one - and only one - Peugeot grinding mechanism, each made of the ideal design and constructed from the best material available for its intended use. All Peugeot mechanisms are made in France and carry a lifetime limited warranty.    Peugeot's Pepper Grinding Mechanism is a two stage burr-style system. During production, the helix-shaped grooves and grinding teeth of the pepper mechanism are individually cut before the steel is case hardened to make it virtually indestructible. The mechanism is then given a proprietary treatment to provide additional protection against corrosion. During use, the helix- shaped grooves guide whole peppercorns through the mechanism to crack, then grind to a consistent size by a double row of teeth. This process releases the pepper's essential oils, resulting in more flavor and aroma for your dish. This patented mechanism is found on every Peugeot Pepper mill and is widely considered the best pepper mechanism available      Peugeot's Salt Crushing Mechanism features two ribbed plates which work to fracture and crush coarse, dry sea salt to a consistent size. The salt grinding mechanism is made of corrosion resistant Stainless Steel, and is found on every Peugeot Salt Mill.       Peugeot's Spice Mechanism is made of ceramic, and is specially designed to grind dried spices and flat leafy herbs to release their essential oils. It is particularly effective with dried aromatic herbs such as thyme, parsley, basil, oregano, and herbs de Provence, as well as dried seeds such as cumin.       Peugeot's Chili Pepper Mechanism is made of case hardened steel for optimal hardness and resilience. This patented mechanism features a pre-cutting system and dual chamber reservoir. For use with dry, hot chilis such as birds tongue, African devils and Piri Piri.     The Nutmeg Shaving Mechanism is made of treated stainless steel which is corrosion resistant, and offers superior edge retention. The Peugeot nutmeg shaver is equipped with a double stainless steel grater blade and a strong claw which enables the whole nutmeg to be very finely shaved, while keeping fingers safe. Intended for use with whole nutmeg nuts.       Peugeot's Wet Salt mechanism has been specially designed for wet sea salt: a spiral guides the salt, ensuring that it does not stick together. The mechanism is made of ceramic because wet salt crystals are soft (wear is not an issue) but corrosive. Intended for use with damp sea salts such as Sel de Guerande.       The Coffee Grinding Mechanism found in all Peugeot coffee mills is the foundation of Peugeot's grinding legacy. The case-hardened steel mechanism efficiently cracks and grinds coffee beans to the desired consistency:from espresso fine to coffee- press coarse.          Peugeot Manual Mills For best results, hold mill and turn mill top in a clockwise direction only To adjust the Grind on manual mills not equipped with u'Select, turn the adjustment nut located on the top of the mill.  - clockwise to obtain a finer grind  - counter-clockwise to obtain a coarser grind          Peugeot Electric Mill  Electric mills permit single-handed use, leaving you free to cook at the same time. Just press the button to start grinding.  Classic Electric Pepper Mills To adjust the grind on an electric mill, turn the thumbwheel grind adjustment (found below the grinding mechanism on electric mills that are not equipped with the u'Select system). - Clockwise to obtain a finer grind, - Counter-clockwise to obtain a coarser grind.   Classic Electric Salt Mills Classic Electric Salt Mills (not fitted with the u'Select grind adjustment system) are pre-set to medium and cannot be adjusted.

The Green Earth Frying Pan Set by Ozeri includes an 8, 10 and 12 inch pan with each pan featuring a honeycomb ceramic cooking surface designed to prevent food bonding. The elevations of the textured cooking surface also create air pockets which distribute heat underneath food to enhance cooking performance. Conventional cookware and other ceramic cookware brands achieve their non-stick performance through a coating of PTFE (PolyTetraFluoroEthylene), a synthetic substance that has waxy properties. At very high temperatures, PTFE begins to decompose and release fumes which are documented to be lethal to birds and small pets, and can be harmful to humans. In addition, traditional pans incorporating PTFE are often manufactured with the aid of PFOA (PerFluoroOctanoic Acid), which the EPA has classified as a 'persistent pollutant of the environment', and APEO (Alkylphenol ethoxylates), which are under restricted use in Germany due to environmental concerns about their poor biodegradability, toxicity to aquatic life, and potential to act as endocrine disrupters. With the Green Earth Pan's GREBLON ceramic, even under high temperatures, no harmful toxic fumes are ever released into the environment. This is because each pan utilizes a 100% ceramic coating inspired by nature - not a laboratory. In addition to being completely free of PTFE, PFOA and APEO, each pan is also far more durable and scratch-resistant than other non-stick surfaces. With better non-stick properties, the Green Earth Pan allows you to saute, fry, bake, boil and braise with as little as half the amount of oil normally used, and cleaning is a breeze. Each Green Earth Pan is made of the highest quality die-cast aluminum that allows for even cooking and fantastic browning without hot spots. Each pan boasts a magnetized bottom for rapid heat transfer on induction stoves, and a heat resistant silicone coated handle. GREBLON ceramic made by Weilburger GmbH, Germany.
