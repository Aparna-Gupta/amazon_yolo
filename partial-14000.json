A quality mill with a specifically designed grinding mechanism will release the aromas and essential oils of that spice. Freshly ground pepper and spices have more aroma and better flavor than pre- ground. Another advantage of using freshly ground spices or minerals (salts) is the control a mill provides for determining the coarseness (size) of a grind. A high quality pepper, salt or spice mill gives you the ability to choose and change the coarseness according to taste or necessity.  How to Choose a Good Mill When looking for a pepper, salt or spice grinder, consider the following: Grinding mechanism: Choose a grinding mechanism that can withstand daily use: one that is well made and produces a consistent grind. Ideally, the grinding mechanism should be designed to handle a specific spice, as each spice has different physical characteristics that will benefit from different design features.  Design and appearance: Whether it's traditional or modern, manual or electric, a mill can be an indispensable tool in your kitchen and a beautiful part of table d\ufffdcor.  Ease of Use: A quality mill should be easy to adjust, easy to fill, and feel comfortable in the hand.  History of Peugeot Peugeot's story starts in the 19th century when the Peugeot brothers converted the family's gristmill into a steel foundry. They began producing award winning hand tools immediately after opening and went on to produce a diverse range of exceptional quality products including small appliances, bicycles and most notably, automobiles. (Although now operating as a separate company, the Peugeot car company continues the same commitment to quality and innovation that is a Peugeot hallmark). In 1840 Peugeot created their burr style coffee grinder and adopted that design to accommodate peppercorns in 1874. The resulting pepper mechanism design is still used today in every Peugeot pepper mill. Peugeot's iconic pepper grinding mechanism design is often copied, but never equaled. Today, Peugeot offers six unique spice-specific mechanisms plus the original burr-style coffee grinder. There are no shortcuts: each mechanism is designed to get the most out of the spices they are intended for. After more than 160 years, Peugeot mills and grinders remain the benchmark of the industry and have earned their position as the mill of choice in world class kitchens. It's All About the Mechanism  The primary difference between Peugeot and all other brands are the spice-specific mechanisms. Peugeot has 7 unique spice specific mechanisms for pepper, salt, herbs and spices, coffee, wet salt, chili peppers and nutmeg. For each spice, there is one - and only one - Peugeot grinding mechanism, each made of the ideal design and constructed from the best material available for its intended use. All Peugeot mechanisms are made in France and carry a lifetime limited warranty.    Peugeot's Pepper Grinding Mechanism is a two stage burr-style system. During production, the helix-shaped grooves and grinding teeth of the pepper mechanism are individually cut before the steel is case hardened to make it virtually indestructible. The mechanism is then given a proprietary treatment to provide additional protection against corrosion. During use, the helix- shaped grooves guide whole peppercorns through the mechanism to crack, then grind to a consistent size by a double row of teeth. This process releases the pepper's essential oils, resulting in more flavor and aroma for your dish. This patented mechanism is found on every Peugeot Pepper mill and is widely considered the best pepper mechanism available      Peugeot's Salt Crushing Mechanism features two ribbed plates which work to fracture and crush coarse, dry sea salt to a consistent size. The salt grinding mechanism is made of corrosion resistant Stainless Steel, and is found on every Peugeot Salt Mill.       A Peugeot Innovation u'Select is Peugeot's patented grind control system for electric and manual grinders. Beyond personal preferences, different stages of the preparation / cooking process and different dishes often call for seasonings of varying sizes. Peugeot now offers the ability to quickly, easily and accurately adjust the grind settings with its patented u'Select system.   From coarsely ground pepper or salt to very fine, u'Select offers: -6 pre-defined levels of grind for pepper, or any point in between. -6 pre-defined levels of grind for salt, or any point in between. Simplicity: just turn the ring at the base of the mill and select your grind size. The further you turn the ring, the finer or coarser the grind, depending on the direction turned. Precision: no risk that the grind will change during use.  The right grind: You are assured that with each setting, the grind will be consistent, time after time.     Fine or coarse grind-is it just a question of taste? Actually it depends on personal taste and the dish being prepared. While personal taste plays a role, some dishes call for coarse salt or pepper, whereas others require either or both to be finely ground. A finer grind will be used for a delicate sauce or mixed raw vegetables and a coarse grind for grilling a steak or when making heartier meats and dishes.    Anatomy of u'Select Mills These mills feature the innovative u'Select system. u'Select mills have the same renowned grinding mechanisms, beauty and functionality as classic Peugeot mills with an additional feature of easy grind selection. When you want to adjust the grind of your salt/pepper to more coarse or fine, you simply turn the u'Select ring at the base of the mill. You can select one of six pre-marked positions, or any point in between, for infinite possibilities. Your selection will not move or change until you want it to.    Manual MillsFor best grinding results: hold the mill body steady and turn mill top in a clockwise direction only    Electric Mills Press the Power switch to grind pepper or salt. Light will illuminate underneath mill when power switch is pressed. u'Select Ring:The narrower the wedge, the finer the grind.   Which pepper and which salt can be used in Peugeot Mills? Pepper:  To get the best results, we recommend you to use only dry, hard, whole peppercorns that are 5 mm (1/4\") or less in diameter. Black, white and dry green peppercorns can be ground in Peugeot pepper mills. Pink peppercorns can be ground only if in a blend (max 15% pink) with one of these other peppercorns. Dried coriander seeds are also suitable for the pepper mechanism.  Salt:  To get the best out of your Peugeot salt grinding mechanism, you should use: dry salt, ideally with a diameter of 4 mm (0.16\") such as coarse sea salt or rock salt (salt mined from an underground salt seam). Do not use your Peugeot salt mill for grinding pepper or any other spice, or damp sea salt (also known as grey salt, Guerande, Re, etc.) The moisture content is so high in damp salt that it will corrode the mill. Use a Peugeot Wet Salt mill with a mechanism specifically designed for damp salt. Its shape and materials have been designed to resist salt corrosion.

Dishwasher-safe, Durable Composition Schott Zwiesel's process tempers each of the zones of stemware that are most prone to breakage: the rim, the junction of the bowl and stem, and the junction of the foot and stem. The added strength of the Tritan composition along these zones renders the stemware chip and break-resistant and allows the pieces to stand up to the abuse of daily use.  The highly durable composition also gives Tritan glassware the ability to withstand extensive dishwashing without etching, discoloring or clouding the material. Independent, long-term testing has proven our new crystal glass shines through 3,000 dishwasher cycles without damage, blemish or any loss of brilliance. Designed with Better Taste in Mind Schott Zwiesel creates Tritan Crystal Glass with aesthetic beauty in mind, but also with purpose.Each piece provides total balance by proportionately engineering the height, width, weight, and capacity of the glass. The proper pour capacity is measured in each wine glass at the bowl's widest point. This leaves the correct distance between the wine and the stemware's rim, which allows the glass to be turned sideways and experience characteristics of each wine varietal's bouquet at maximum potential.  Additionally, the laser-cut rim of each piece creates a smooth path for wine to travel into one's palate. When the stemware is tipped back, the straight rim directs wine to spill at the appropriate section of the palate where a high concentration of taste buds can catch and savor each and every flavor of the wine. Laser-etched effervescent points in champagne flutes, which direct a cascade of bubbles to the center of the flute provide a longer lasting effervescence to champagnes and sparkling wines- a once hidden detail only experienced by much more expensive crystal.  A \"Sense-ationally\" Detailed Experience Stimulate all four senses, sight, taste, smell and touch through unmatched details found in Tritan Crystal Glass. Firm and secure in the hand, Tritan's remarkable strength is matched by uncompromised aesthetic quality and a unique visual flair. With versatile designs, whether it's Classic, Traditional, Modern, or Dramatic, Tritan has a style to complement any personal style. Using laser cutting and etching technology, Schott Zwiesel also aims to maximize enjoyment of a drink's flavor and fragrance. Finally, experience also the fifth sense, the distinct ringing sound of high quality crystal glasses along with the fine, smooth polished rims, and seamless stems.   Environmental Consciousness Schott Zwiesel protects the natural environment by conserving resources and making optimal use of energy in the manufacture of our products. The patented Tritan crystal glass collections are lead and barium free, created with only natural materials and designed for functional use and long-lasting brilliance.

Make ironing less of a chore with help from Panasonic's Concept 360-Degree Quick steam/dry iron. The sleek-looking unit delivers an array of advanced features for safety and exceptional convenience, making it easy to move quickly and efficiently through anything from slacks and skirts to button-down shirts to table linen.   Extra-large soleplate with curved, elliptical shape for smooth, effortless gliding. (Model NI-W750TS shown.)  Innovative Dual-Point Design   Vertical steam from all steam holes--great for curtains or hanging garments. (Model NI-W750TS shown.)  The iron's soleplate offers a unique elliptical shape for faster results. While conventional straight-backed soleplates may sometimes catch on fabric and actually create creases when moving backwards or side to side, the elliptical-shaped soleplate prevents creasing with points at either end, allowing for smooth, effortless gliding in any direction. The iron's uniquely designed soleplate not only makes it possible to move backwards without fabric bunching up, but it also eliminates wasted motion (no need for several U-turns) and helps save time--up to 25-percent faster*. Furthermore, the bottom of the soleplate comes slightly curved to ensure smooth side-to-side movements, and the edge of the soleplate can always be viewed from above, which allows for precise control when ironing pleats, between buttons, and along seams. The multi-directional iron also supplies steam holes around the entire edge of the soleplate for efficient wrinkle removal, and its generous size quickly covers more surface area in less time--great for larger fabrics like curtains and tablecloths. Custom Control The 360-Degree Quick iron also provides user-friendly controls. A turn of the dial makes it easy to adjust the heat--select from one of five fabric settings. For added convenience, the iron's jet-of-steam function delivers a powerful burst of steam to help remove stubborn wrinkles when ironing, plus it effectively cleans the steam vents when finished, which helps keep the iron in good working order. The iron also offers a gentler option--the spay-mist button, which delivers extra moisture where needed. Use the iron on a flat surface for traditional ironing or hold it upright for vertically steaming out wrinkles from curtains or hanging garments. For added versatility, the iron's adjustable steam button allows for selecting just the right amount of steam for the job. Choose from four steam settings: \"high\" steam for heavier fabrics, \"medium\" steam for touch-ups, \"low\" steam for delicate fabrics, or \"dry\" for no steam output. Awarded the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval, the 360-Degree Quick steam/dry iron measures 10-13/16 by 4-7/8 by 5-7/8 inches and carries a one-year limited warranty.

Large, Curved Titanium- or Ceramic-Coated Soleplate The iron glides smoothly and effortlessly in any direction, and the generous-sized soleplate lets you get the job done quicker. Three-Way Auto Shut-Off Remembers to Turn Off the Iron When You Don't No more trips back home to see if you left the iron on. Our mercury-free electronic sensor automatically shuts off the iron after 10 minutes if it is left in the upright position. The iron will also turn off after 60 seconds if it is tipped over on its side or left unmoved on the soleplate. Stay-Clean Vents An anti-calcium system prevents clogged steam vents by reducing the sediment build-up in the vaporizing chamber of the iron. Easy-to-Use The iron has an oversized water tank, plus the temperature-control dial maintains precise temperature settings. Select the Amount of Steam for the Job The adjustable steam button allows you to select just the right amount of steam required for your ironing needs. Choose regular steam for heavier fabrics or light steam for touch-ups. Steam or Dry Ironing--the Choice is Yours With our steam/dry selector, you can select to steam or dry iron by simply pushing a button. 2-for-1 with Jet-of-Steam and Self-Cleaning A powerful burst of steam helps remove stubborn wrinkles when ironing. It also helps clean the steam vents on the soleplate after ironing. Spray Mist the Wrinkles Away The spay mist button helps eliminate stubborn wrinkles by directing extra moisture where necessary. Vertical Steam With the push of a button, the vertical steam feature allows you to direct a burst of steam to hanging garments. *When compared to conventional corded Panasonic irons.

The sleek-looking unit delivers an array of advanced features for safety and exceptional convenience, making it easy to move quickly and efficiently through anything from slacks and skirts to button-down shirts to table linen.   Extra-large soleplate with curved, elliptical shape for smooth, effortless gliding. (Model NI-W750TS shown.)  Innovative Dual-Point Design   Vertical steam from all steam holes--great for curtains or hanging garments. (Model NI-W750TS shown.)  The iron's soleplate offers a unique elliptical shape for faster results. While conventional straight-backed soleplates may sometimes catch on fabric and actually create creases when moving backwards or side to side, the elliptical-shaped soleplate prevents creasing with points at either end, allowing for smooth, effortless gliding in any direction. The iron's uniquely designed soleplate not only makes it possible to move backwards without fabric bunching up, but it also eliminates wasted motion (no need for several U-turns) and helps save time--up to 25-percent faster*. Furthermore, the bottom of the soleplate comes slightly curved to ensure smooth side-to-side movements, and the edge of the soleplate can always be viewed from above, which allows for precise control when ironing pleats, between buttons, and along seams. The multi-directional iron also supplies steam holes around the entire edge of the soleplate for efficient wrinkle removal, and its generous size quickly covers more surface area in less time--great for larger fabrics like curtains and tablecloths. Custom Control The 360-Degree Quick iron also provides user-friendly controls. A turn of the dial makes it easy to adjust the heat--select from one of five fabric settings. For added convenience, the iron's jet-of-steam function delivers a powerful burst of steam to help remove stubborn wrinkles when ironing, plus it effectively cleans the steam vents when finished, which helps keep the iron in good working order. The iron also offers a gentler option--the spay-mist button, which delivers extra moisture where needed. Use the iron on a flat surface for traditional ironing or hold it upright for vertically steaming out wrinkles from curtains or hanging garments. For added versatility, the iron's adjustable steam button allows for selecting just the right amount of steam for the job. Choose from four steam settings: \"high\" steam for heavier fabrics, \"medium\" steam for touch-ups, \"low\" steam for delicate fabrics, or \"dry\" for no steam output. Awarded the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval, the 360-Degree Quick steam/dry iron measures 10-13/16 by 4-7/8 by 5-7/8 inches and carries a one-year limited warranty. Detailed Features: Up to 25-Percent Faster Ironing* Natural. Easy. Convenient. Quickly get to those tight spots like collars and cuffs without rotating the iron or yourself. Speeds up larger jobs like tablecloths or curtains. Iron in any direction with precision, ease and speed.   Highlights    Symmetrical Dual-Point Control  Quick multi-directional ironing Ironing control in tight spots Creaseless ironing  Curved Soleplate  Smooth sideways motion Generous size gets the job done quicker Titanium or ceramic coating  Steam Vents  More steam, less wrinkles Vertical steam from all steam holes  Easy to Use  Oversized water tank Temperature control dial maintains precise temperature 360-degree rotating cord Lightweight, ergonomic design feels balanced in the hand     Innovative Design High-tech, sleek, and ergonomic design ensures smooth, natural movement in any direction. Large, Curved Titanium- or Ceramic-Coated Soleplate The iron glides smoothly and effortlessly in any direction, and the generous-sized soleplate lets you get the job done quicker. Three-Way Auto Shut-Off Remembers to Turn Off the Iron When You Don't No more trips back home to see if you left the iron on. Our mercury-free electronic sensor automatically shuts off the iron after 10 minutes if it is left in the upright position. The iron will also turn off after 60 seconds if it is tipped over on its side or left unmoved on the soleplate. Stay-Clean Vents An anti-calcium system prevents clogged steam vents by reducing the sediment build-up in the vaporizing chamber of the iron. Easy-to-Use The iron has an oversized water tank, plus the temperature-control dial maintains precise temperature settings. Select the Amount of Steam for the Job The adjustable steam button allows you to select just the right amount of steam required for your ironing needs. Choose regular steam for heavier fabrics or light steam for touch-ups. Steam or Dry Ironing--the Choice is Yours With our steam/dry selector, you can select to steam or dry iron by simply pushing a button. 2-for-1 with Jet-of-Steam and Self-Cleaning A powerful burst of steam helps remove stubborn wrinkles when ironing. It also helps clean the steam vents on the soleplate after ironing. Spray Mist the Wrinkles Away The spay mist button helps eliminate stubborn wrinkles by directing extra moisture where necessary. Vertical Steam With the push of a button, the vertical steam feature allows you to direct a burst of steam to hanging garments. *When compared to conventional corded Panasonic irons.

Joyce Chen by Columbian Home Products In 1949 Joyce Chen came to America from Shanghai, China and settled in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Her culinary career began when she brought egg rolls to her children's school bake sale -- they sold out immediately. She had discovered America's growing interest in Chinese food. She soon began teaching lessons at her home and, later, at Cambridge's and Boston's Adult Education Centers. With the encouragement of friends and neighbors, she opened The Joyce Chen Restaurant in 1958. She also wrote her first Joyce Chen Cook Book in 1964, and in 1968 starred in her own national televised PBS cooking series called Joyce Chen Cooks. In the '70s, she found that the selection and quality of Chinese cookware in America didn't live up to her high standards, so she developed her own line of cookware with the slogan \"Eastern Cookware for the Western Kitchen.\" Her goal was to provide high-quality, versatile tools and products with Asian flair. Today, sourced from all over the Pacific Rim, Joyce Chen products bring the best of Asia to you. In 1994 Joyce Chen passed away and in 1998, she was inducted into the James Beard Foundation Hall of Fame.

Simply attach the specially manufactured wider 150mm 6inch hose to your existing 125/130mm 5inch hose using the heat resistant white PVC duct tape supplied. Note that the extension hose is supplied is larger to allow for the increased length and correct ventilation of hot air. High quality White PVC Duct hose supplied is specially manufactured to resist leaking heat back into the room and is extra flexible to allow for versatility. Image is for illustration of hose type that can be extended. Always Consult your AC unit users guide for Venting information. QUESTIONS: Q, Why is the hose supplied larger that the one I have? A, If you added an extra three metres to your AC unit duct and did not increase the diameter, the motor in the AC unit would not be able to expel the hot air fast enough and would overheat... Q, Why is the hose supplied more flexible that the original Duct that came with the AC Unit? A, Adding three metres of Duct with the same tough semi rigid plastic pipe supplied would be heavy and also in most cases difficult to position. The added flexability allows for light weight easy placment where you most need the cooler. Q, Doesnt the think PVC tube supplied just get hot and reheat the room? A, Absolutely not, The amount of hot air expelled from the room is far greater than any heat that is radiated back from the warm pipe. Q, Some of the reviews say the tube is paper thin and could rip,. A, That is correct, People have said that but none say it actually ripped!. The PVC is specially made to be thin making it very Light. It is also very Tough.

The single baking chamber allows sauces to flow evenly throughout the pan, and the durable nonstick coating releases even the stickiest foods with ease. Lasagna also bakes more consistently in the Simple Lasagna Pan because more heat is distributed to the pan's middle, where food typically takes longer to bake.

The smooth side is great for making grilled cheese sandwiches as well as eggs, pancakes and french toast. The ribbed side is perfect for grilling foods such as steak, fish, chicken and hamburgers. The food sits above the grease making your cooking experience much healthier. Seasoned and ready to use. 16-3/16\" x 9-7/16\" x 1/2\" The following use and care instructions for Lodge Seasoned Cast Iron\u00a0will help your\u00a0cookware\u00a0last a lifetime. \u00a0  If you do Nothing Else...  Hand wash. Dry immediately\u2014even before first use. Rub with a light coat of vegetable oil after every wash. How much oil? Enough to restore the sheen, without being \u201csticky\u201d. Why? To keep the iron \u201cseasoned\u201d and protected from moisture. \u00a0  Seasoning\u2014It isn't Salt and Pepper  \u201cSeasoning\u201d is vegetable oil baked onto the iron at a high temperature: not a chemical non-stick coating. Seasoning creates the natural, easy-release properties. The more you cook, the better it gets. Because you create, maintain, and even repair the \u201cseasoning\u201d, your cookware can last 100 years or more. Chemical non-stick coating cannot be repaired, limiting lifespan. \u00a0  Let's Cook!  Lodge Cast Iron is right at home on induction, ceramic, electric and gas cooktops, in your oven, on the grill, or even over the campfire. Do not use in the microwave. On glass or ceramic cooktops, lift cookware; never slide it. Our cookware is safe at high temperatures; use metal, wood, or hi-temp silicone utensils. Some foods may stick to new cookware (especially eggs). Use a little extra oil or butter until you\u2019ve built up the seasoning. Acidic foods like tomatoes, beans, and certain sauces can damage seasoning, and should be avoided until the seasoning is well-established. Cast Iron rarely needs to go above a medium heat setting when properly pre-heated.\u00a0For the times when you\u00a0do cook at\u00a0higher temperatures, bring the pan to temperature gradually and add oil to\u00a0just before adding food to prevent sticking. Our handles get hot; use mitts. Use trivets to protect countertops from hot cookware. \u00a0  To Soap or not to Soap...  If no soap is too scary, wash with mild soapy water and dry and oil immediately. However, consider that cookware is 400\u00baF in 4 minutes on medium heat and is sterile at 212\u00ba F, so soap isn\u2019t always necessary. Dishwashers, strong detergents and metal scouring pads are not recommended, as they\u00a0remove seasoning. \u00a0  Rust?! Don't Panic, it's not Broken  Without protective seasoning iron can rust. It\u2019s really easy to fix. Scour the rust, rinse, dry, and rub with a little vegetable oil. If problem persists, you will need to thoroughly remove all rust and follow our re-seasoning instructions (below). \u00a0  Refurbish Your Finish  While maintaining the seasoning should keep your Cast Iron and\u00a0Carbon Steel\u00a0in good condition, at some point you may need to re-season your cookware. If food sticks to the surface, or you notice a dull, gray color, repeat the seasoning process: * Wash the cookware with hot, soapy water and a stiff brush. (It is okay to use soap this time because you are preparing to re-season the cookware). * Rinse and dry completely. * Apply a very thin, even coating of MELTED solid vegetable shortening (or cooking oil of your choice) to the cookware inside and out. Too much oil will result in a sticky finish. * Place aluminum foil on the bottom rack of the oven (not directly on bottom) to catch any drips. * Set oven temperature to 350 \u2013 400 degrees F. * Place cookware upside down on the top rack of the oven to prevent pooling. * Bake the cookware for at least one hour. After the hour, turn the oven off and let the cookware cool in the oven. * Store the cookware uncovered, in a dry place when cooled. * Repeat as necessary.\u00a0\u00a0 Check out this helpful video too. \u00a0  Some Basics  Gas flames should not extend up the sides of cookware. Match pan size to burner size. Don\u2019t use in the microwave. When deep frying, fill cookware only to 1/3 of capacity.

Additionally, special AccuCharge Circuitry constantly monitors the battery until fully charged, and then reduces power to a trickle to complete and maintain the charge. This results in a reduction of energy consumption by 70%!  With 15-3/5 volts of suction power and an easy-to-maneuver cordless design, this handheld vacuum cleaner works great for on-the-go pickups and fast cleaning of every day messes and dry spills. The handy tool features AccuCharge technology, which provides a longer battery life and charges twice as fast. Plus, its circuitry constantly monitors the unit until it reaches the charge voltage, then it reduces power to a trickle to complete and maintain the charge, which means 70-percent less energy consumption. The unit's battery charger has earned an ENERGY STAR rating, which means it meets strict energy-efficiency guidelines for battery chargers set by the EPA and U.S. Department of Energy.  ENERGY STAR qualified battery chargers can help save on energy bills, as well as on greenhouse gas emissions--all of which means a cleaner house without excess costs or impact on the environment.

He sold only one painting during his lifetime, and was little known to the art world at the time of his death, but his fame grew rapidly thereafter. His influence on Expressionism, Fauvism and early abstraction was enormous, and it can be seen in many of his works. Giclee (jee-clay) is an advanced printmaking process for creating high quality fine art reproductions. The attainable excellence that Giclee printmaking affords makes the reproduction virtually indistinguishable from the original piece. The result is wide acceptance of Giclee by galleries, museums, and private collectors.

Sleek and streamlined, the NEW CoffeeTEAM GS features a space-saving design, plus convenient features that make it easy to grind and brew fresh and flavorful coffee every day.  Sleek LookFeature and Benefits The CoffeeTEAM GS lets you program the amount of coffee you want to grind: choose from 2, 4, 6, 8 or 10 cups and select mild, regular or strong. The coffee filter holder stays inside the machine during grinder preserving more aroma and reducing mechanical movements. You can even program two completely different settings, one for manual operation and one for automatic operation. This way you always enjoy exactly the same coffee taste.  The CoffeeTEAM uses solid steel conical burrs, the same as found in our automatic coffee centers. The slow grinding of the burrs imparts minimal heat preserving more aroma than blade grinding. It also allows a finer and more uniform grind than combination machines with a blade grinder.  Five fineness settings for light to dark beans let you adjust the grinder to your preferred beans (the darker/oilier the bean, the coarser the setting). 6 ounce bean container.  Direct-feed technology accommodates a more compact design while keeping moisture away from the grinder. The CoffeeTEAM GS grinds the programmed amount of beans directly into the filter and then automatically initiates the brewing process.  AM/PM Programmable Clock/Timer lets you set the time when to grind and brew automatically.  The easy-to-read LCD display shows the time, grind and strength settings. Charcoal water filter removes up to 82% of chlorine and other impurities. 10-cup Glass Carafe.  GoldTone Filter included. CoffeeTEAM GS can also be used with size 4 filter paper. Over 200 degrees F brew and 180 degrees F coffee temperature in glass carafe directly after brewing.  2 Hour Safety Shut-Off will keep the coffee hot for two hours after brewing. Then the heating element will shut off by itself conserving energy and giving you peace of mind.  The unit can be used with or without the grinder, accommodating pre-ground coffee, including flavored coffees or decaf. Choose the BREW MODE for pre-ground coffee or GRIND/BREW MODE for whole bean coffee. Stop-and-Serve lets you remove the carafe while brewing to serve a quick cup.

Designed with a detachable telescopic wand and on-board tools including an Air-Powered Hand Tool for hard to reach areas, and a power nozzle with swivel neck to reach around furniture legs and corners with ease.  A combination of Hoover's WindTunnel Technology and a multi-cyclonic filtration system results in a platinum clean with no loss of suction Equipped with Hoover's patented WindTunnel technology and three distinct air tunnels, this bagless canister vacuum cleaner effectively lifts and removes dirt and debris, trapping it inside the cleaner instead of scattered back out on the floor.  The Cyclonic Bagless Canister features a Multi-Stage Cyclonic Filtration System, which cleans the air moving through the filter to ensure no loss of suction, with all the power needed to get floors truly clean. Its fingertip controls offer comfortable access to the power button, suction control, and brush-roll switch.  Turn the rotating brush on when vacuuming low- to high-pile carpets and rugs; flip the switch off for safely cleaning hardwood and other bare-floor surfaces. A foot-petal control adjusts the nozzle to accommodate different carpet heights and floor types.  For above-floor cleaning, the vacuum provides a 7-foot hose, a detachable telescopic wand, and a variety of on-board tools. Use the turbo tool for stairs; the crevice tool for between couch cushions or other tight spots; the dusting brush for bookshelves, vents, and lamp shades; and the upholstery brush for curtains, living-room chairs, couches, and more.  The unit's multi-stage cyclonic filtration system keeps the air that moves through the filter substantially cleaner than the air being pulled into the vacuum, which helps ensure the vacuum doesn't lose suction power when cleaning.

End Grain: Made from the end of the bamboo, the hardest section. The highest quality bamboo cutting board available. It is perfect for heavy chopping and cutting.

Choose from a variety of bamboo cutting boards, kitchen utensils, blocks, and more.  Induction   Induction cooktops for faster, more efficient cooking.  Induction is the third method of cookware; it is more efficient than electricity and faster than gas. It works off of reverse magnetism and has been used by chefs, hotel chains, and caterers globally for many years. It is also widely popular in households in Europe and Asia. To test if your pots and pans are induction ready, do a simple magnet test. If a magnet sticks to the bottom of your pot or pan, it is induction ready. Why induction cooking? You save energy three ways:  Induction heats up your pots/pans super fast, resulting in less cooking time It uses less electricity than an electrical element, and is more efficient (less wasted heat and energy) The pan itself is the element or source of heat, resulting in less temperature  EarthChef Cookware - Care and Maintenance Before your first-time use: After unpacking your cookware, make sure to remove all labels and then wash in warm, soapy water with a soft sponge. Rinse thoroughly and dry completely with a soft cloth. EarthChef cookware is dishwasher-safe, on the economy cycle, but we recommend washing them by hand. This extra care is it uses less water and energy and protects your pans from the harsh heat and detergent of a dishwasher. Before heating your new EarthChef Nonstick cookware for the first time, you should lightly coat the inside of the pan's nonstick surface with a little vegetable oil on a paper towel or soft cloth. This will lightly season the pan's surface and enhance the nonstick properties of the all-natural ceramic coating. Cooking with your new EarthChef products Using oils, butter, or margarine to fry or saute foods in your new EarthChef Nonstick cookware is not necessary due to the all-natural nonstick ceramic coating. If you choose to cook with one of these products to enhance browning or flavor, you should follow these guidelines:  Be sure that you always start with a clean pan. All oils smoke or burn at different temperatures. Be sure to test the oil that you are cooking with at a low to medium heat prior to adding your food to the pan. Add just enough oil to cover the bottom surface. Allow the oil to heat for one to two minutes over low to medium heat before adding food to the pan. The preheated oil will also help enhance the nonstick properties of the pan. Allow your food to come up to room temperature for about 10 minutes before adding it to the pan.  Other helpful tips while using your EarthChef cookware  Always try to match the size of the burner to the base of the cookware piece you are using. If you are using a gas cooktop, be sure to adjust the flame so that it does not flare up the sides of the pan. This will cause discoloration on the outside of the pan, possible damage to the handle, and possible personal injury from getting burned, as well as using more energy. You should use medium heat when preparing meals. You should only use high heat when the pot is full of liquid for boiling pasta, making stocks or deep-frying. While you can use metal utensils with your EarthChef nonstick cookware, they will cause some scratching of the surface and scratches are not covered in the warranty. We recommend using bamboo, silicone, nylon, or wood utensils to protect and extend the life of your pan. Never cut food while in the pan or gouge the pan as this will damage the surface and will not be covered in the warranty. Never allow a pan to boil dry. If you have remains of food stuck to the cookware, for example from blackening fish, they can easily be removed by covering the bottom of the pan with water and letting it soak off at a very low temperature. Burnt-on remains can be removed in a similar way, by letting the water boil in the pot or pan for just a few minutes and then working the burnt area with a wood spoon. Do NOT use a metal utensil as you can gouge the coating's finish. For your stainless-steel cookware, you can also use special detergents such as BergHOFF's Stainless Cleanser or BergHOFF's Magic for Stainless Steel. Care and Cleaning All BergHOFF products are designed to exceed your expectations; however their performance can be diminished if they are not properly cared for. Remember to cool your pans down before cleaning them as you can warp your pan by putting it into water directly from the heat source. Be sure to clean your pan thoroughly after each use, using warm, soapy water and sponge or a dishcloth. Then rinse in warm water and dry immediately to prevent water spotting with a soft cloth. Do NOT use steel wool or nylon scrubbing pads, oven cleaner or any cleaner that is abrasive, is a citrus based cleanser or contains chlorine bleach, especially on your stainless-steel pans as this will damage your pans finish. Do NOT gouge the nonstick coating. While your EarthChef pans are dishwasher-safe, be sure that you do NOT use a detergent on your stainless-steel pans that is based on citric acids (lemons) or contains chlorine bleach. These products can damage the anti-oxidation layer and can lead to corrosive reactions. Any signs of corrosion can easily be removed by using a good stainless-steel cleanser, like BergHOFF's Stainless Cleanser or Magic for Stainless Steel. Also, you should use the lowest heat setting as high drying temperatures can also cause damage to the anti-oxidation layer. The EarthChef cookware comes in two different materials: full stainless steel and aluminum. The non stick-coating on the aluminum pans is naturally six times stronger than any traditional nonstick coating and does not contain toxic or hazardous materials. (PFOA-free and PTFE-free). The strong, professional riveted handles are another feature: made of solid cast stainless steel, they will stay firmly attached for a lifetime. The base on this cookware is suitable for use on any type of cooktop surfaces including induction, making it energy efficient and fast, with a guaranteed even heat transfer.

AirBake continues to provide the best baking results every time. Made of 100-percent aluminum, AirBake Natural provides an overall enhanced baking performance with its insulated aluminum sheets and micro-dome technology to decrease bake times by up to 15% over traditional insulated bakeware. Two heavyweight aluminum sheets surround a layer of air. The air reduces the temperature of the metal that comes in contact with the food. The bottom sheet blocks the direct oven heat while the layer of air acts as an insulator preventing the top sheet from overheating. This means better browning, no burning, and moister baked goods. Set includes 2 cookies sheets 16-inches x 14-inches and comes with a recipe book. CARE INSTRUCTIONS: Before using your bakeware for the first time, wash and condition the bakeware by spreading one teaspoon of cooking oil over the interior with a clean cloth. Wipe off any excess. Avoid overheating your bakeware. In order to preserve and avoid scratches on your coating, we recommend the use of plastic utensils. Slight surface marks or abrasions are normal and will not affect the performance of the non-stick coating. With use, the non-stick surface may become slightly darker. This will not impair its performance. AirBake is designed to breathe and is not watertight. However, AirBake is dishwasher safe. DO NOT USE DISHWASHER DETERGENT TABS - the concentrated cleaning agents will damage the bakeware's finish. DO NOT SOAK - if water is inside pan layer, there is a risk of burning from steam release.

While it may not be the very first recorded food item in the history of humankind, man has been eating nuts for as long as he has been able to find them. Almonds, pecans, acorns, pistachios and all manner of treasures with tough shells have been put into our dishes or eaten as a dish for a very long time - it's tradition. For as long as this has been true, these hundreds of thousands of years, man has developed tools in order to get to the crunchy center of each delicious nut. Initially, these tools were rocks and primitive hammers used to bludgeon open the shell. Later on, they became more advanced and more easy to handle than a sharp stone. Now let's go back to our own time. Nuts are still a staple food item in our diet - particularly here in the US - and for a good reason. The health benefits of eating these delectable fruits are too many to recount. To name one of the most resounding benefits that usually gets attention - people who regularly eat nuts live on average up to five years longer than those who do not. It's tradition for a very good reason - even ancient man knew this. The past 782,000 years have brought about a few changes. One of the most important ones is shelling. You no longer have to whack the shell with a jagged rock in order to open it and enjoy the succulent taste of fresh pecans or pistachios - we have the tools to make this significantly easier for you. Nut shellers have been in production for centuries - it's craftsmanship. Like the nuts themselves, Shellers are a tradition with hundreds of years of history behind them. Different countries have Shellers in different shapes and for different purposes.

What are the advantages of a bagless vacuum? You\u2019ll save on the expense of replacement bags and the need to keep them on hand. Bagless vacuums have clear dirt tanks, which allow you to see the dirt and debris that have been collected so you know when to empty it. It is also easy to remove objects you might accidentally vacuum up.  How often should I change my vacuum\u2019s filters? Many vacuums have filters that need to be cleaned and/ or replaced on a regular basis to keep the vacuum running well. Check your vacuum\u2019s user guide for information on your specific model.

Whether mincing herbs or chopping carrots, onions, and potatoes to throw into a vegetable soup--or even slicing cantaloupe and watermelon for a fruit salad to serve at a barbecue or summer picnic, a high-quality cutting board helps ensure safety, efficiency, and convenience. Epicurean has developed a cutting surface that delivers all that and more. Features  Dishwasher-safe: unlike wood and bamboo cutting boards, Epicurean cutting surfaces are high-quality food-prep surfaces that can be cleaned in the dishwasher. Made in the USA: Epicurean cutting surfaces are exclusively manufactured in the United States of America. NSF Certified: certified by the National Sanitary Foundation, you can be sure that your nonporous Epicurean cutting surface will be easy to clean and will not harbor bacteria. FSC Certified: Epicurean's Natural, Slate, and RC100 materials are all certified by the Forest Stewardship Council. Knife: Epicurean cutting surfaces will score slightly as to not dull your knife so you will sharpen less. Heat-Resistant: Epicurean cutting surfaces are heat-resistant up to 350 degrees F (176 degrees C), so you can use the surface as a trivet without leaving a blemish. (Not microwave-safe and should not be used as cookware.)

In fact, the materials are also certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (Slate, Natural, and RC100 only), and they are National Safety Foundation (NSF) approved (Slate and Natural only), which ensures an easy-to-clean nonporous design that will not harbor bacteria.  Compressed layers of nonporous wood fiber and food-safe resin form a high-quality food-prep surface. The wood-based cutting surface provides a natural look and texture, and it comes in a variety of different earth-toned colors. Each color depends on the combination of fiber sources, which are layered together and pressed along with a food-safe resin to form a highly functional food-prep surface. Over time, the color of the material will develop a richer, more enhanced hue. Knife Friendly Unlike other surfaces, cutting on the wood-based cutting surface won't dull kitchen knives. The surface will score slightly to help protect the knife's edge, which means less need for re-sharpening knife blades. Daily Convenience The cutting surface offers a low-profile design that slips neatly into vertical or horizontal cupboards for space-saving storage between uses. The cutting surface might be best left out on the counter--whether tucked behind the cookie jar or under the basket of fruit--for quick, everyday access. Both sides of the unit work equally well for food preparation--the board can also be used as a serving tray when offering cheese and crackers or other hors d'oeuvres to guests at a party. Furthermore, the board can be used as a trivet on a dining table or buffet to prevent pots and pans for damaging surfaces. The unit can withstand heat up to 350 degrees F (176 degrees C), but it should not be used in the microwave or used as cookware in the oven. Use and Care The cutting surface offers a durable design that can stand up to the rigorous daily use of any busy kitchen. It resists staining and cracking and offers maintenance-free convenience--no need to oil or bleach. Though stain-resistant, the cutting surface may stain if left in contact with a highly alkaline product or food for a prolonged amount of time. Liver, papaya, and red beets, for example, may leave a mark. To remove stubborn stains, try a non-abrasive household cleaner. Made in the USA, the cutting surface can be cleaned in the dishwasher (unlike wood and bamboo cutting boards) or by hand in the sink with hot soapy water. As with any wood product, be sure to dry the cutting surface completely and store upright when not in use to avoid warping. Original, attractive, and functional, the cutting surface offers exceptional convenience to any home or commercial kitchen.

Sometimes referred to as a low speed juicer, the VRT processes at 80rpm, whereas most other juicers process at a speed of 1,650 to 15,000rpm. The low speed protects and maintains healthy enzymes, prevents oxidation and allows juice to be stored up to 72 hours without degradation. The VRT330's dual stage juice processing system extracts the maximum amount of juice from fruits, vegetables, leafy greens, even wheatgrass! Add a variety of fruits and vegetables with minimal prep work thanks to the juicer's wide feed-chute opening. The innovative cleaning system wipes the screen clear during juicing increasing the VRT's efficiency.   Easy to Use The vertical design of the VRT330 makes the juicer very compact, taking up minimal space on your countertop. Easy to assemble, the hopper attaches to the bowl, which then attaches to the base. The VRT330 also features two spouts and two 50-ounce containers -- one for fresh juice and one for pulp ejection. The patented screw design of the auger is more efficient when squeezing and pressing ingredients to extract juice. The hopper is conveniently located at the top of the juicer. The VRT comes with a pusher to push ingredients into the juicer. The innovative cleaning system wipes the screen clear during juicing, increasing the VRT's efficiency. You can also pour water through the chute to self clean the juicer when changing ingredients. Features  Juicer processes at 80rpm's squeezing instead of grinding, which allows the juice to maintain its pure color, natural taste, vitamins and nutrients.  Small, vertical footprint takes up less space in your kitchen.  Dual stage juicer. First, juice is extracted by crushing the fruit or vegetable. Then, before the pulp is ejected, the pulp is squeezed during the second pressed stage. Includes 1 juicing screens -- fine. Fine for those that like less pulp. The low speed system limits froth and foam preventing oxidation. Juice can be stored for up to 72 hours without degradation or juice separation.

Make ironing less of a chore with help from Panasonic's Concept 360-Degree Quick steam/dry iron. The sleek-looking unit delivers an array of advanced features for safety and exceptional convenience, making it easy to move quickly and efficiently through anything from slacks and skirts to button-down shirts to table linen.   Extra-large soleplate with curved, elliptical shape for smooth, effortless gliding. (Model NI-W750TS shown.)  Innovative Dual-Point Design   Vertical steam from all steam holes--great for curtains or hanging garments. (Model NI-W750TS shown.)  The iron's soleplate offers a unique elliptical shape for faster results. While conventional straight-backed soleplates may sometimes catch on fabric and actually create creases when moving backwards or side to side, the elliptical-shaped soleplate prevents creasing with points at either end, allowing for smooth, effortless gliding in any direction. The iron's uniquely designed soleplate not only makes it possible to move backwards without fabric bunching up, but it also eliminates wasted motion (no need for several U-turns) and helps save time--up to 25-percent faster*. Furthermore, the bottom of the soleplate comes slightly curved to ensure smooth side-to-side movements, and the edge of the soleplate can always be viewed from above, which allows for precise control when ironing pleats, between buttons, and along seams. The multi-directional iron also supplies steam holes around the entire edge of the soleplate for efficient wrinkle removal, and its generous size quickly covers more surface area in less time--great for larger fabrics like curtains and tablecloths. Custom Control The 360-Degree Quick iron also provides user-friendly controls. A turn of the dial makes it easy to adjust the heat--select from one of five fabric settings. For added convenience, the iron's jet-of-steam function delivers a powerful burst of steam to help remove stubborn wrinkles when ironing, plus it effectively cleans the steam vents when finished, which helps keep the iron in good working order. The iron also offers a gentler option--the spay-mist button, which delivers extra moisture where needed. Use the iron on a flat surface for traditional ironing or hold it upright for vertically steaming out wrinkles from curtains or hanging garments. For added versatility, the iron's adjustable steam button allows for selecting just the right amount of steam for the job. Choose from four steam settings: \"high\" steam for heavier fabrics, \"medium\" steam for touch-ups, \"low\" steam for delicate fabrics, or \"dry\" for no steam output. Awarded the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval, the 360-Degree Quick steam/dry iron measures 10-13/16 by 4-7/8 by 5-7/8 inches and carries a one-year limited warranty. Detailed Features: Up to 25-Percent Faster Ironing* Natural. Easy. Convenient. Quickly get to those tight spots like collars and cuffs without rotating the iron or yourself.

Large, Curved Titanium- or Ceramic-Coated Soleplate The iron glides smoothly and effortlessly in any direction, and the generous-sized soleplate lets you get the job done quicker. Three-Way Auto Shut-Off Remembers to Turn Off the Iron When You Don't No more trips back home to see if you left the iron on. Our mercury-free electronic sensor automatically shuts off the iron after 10 minutes if it is left in the upright position. The iron will also turn off after 60 seconds if it is tipped over on its side or left unmoved on the soleplate. Stay-Clean Vents An anti-calcium system prevents clogged steam vents by reducing the sediment build-up in the vaporizing chamber of the iron. Easy-to-Use The iron has an oversized water tank, plus the temperature-control dial maintains precise temperature settings. Select the Amount of Steam for the Job The adjustable steam button allows you to select just the right amount of steam required for your ironing needs. Choose regular steam for heavier fabrics or light steam for touch-ups. Steam or Dry Ironing--the Choice is Yours With our steam/dry selector, you can select to steam or dry iron by simply pushing a button. 2-for-1 with Jet-of-Steam and Self-Cleaning A powerful burst of steam helps remove stubborn wrinkles when ironing. It also helps clean the steam vents on the soleplate after ironing. Spray Mist the Wrinkles Away The spay mist button helps eliminate stubborn wrinkles by directing extra moisture where necessary.

Deep clean what vacuums leave behind and make sure dirt, spots, and stains are gone for good. Learn more about deep cleaning.We recommend deep cleaning your carpets at least twice a year\u2014or more if you have pets, kids, or a smoker in the house. Deep Cleaning FAQs Deep cleaning is a carpet cleaning process that loosens and removes harmful dirt and ground-in grit that could otherwise cause serious harm to carpet fibers. Carpet deep cleaning helps protects your flooring and keep it looking its best for years to come. Everyone should perform a deep cleaning regimen two times a year, but if you have pets and children you may want to consider doing it a few more times. There\u2019s No Clean Like a Deep Clean It\u2019s time to go beyond vacuuming since vacuuming alone isn\u2019t enough. Our Deep cleaning systems are engineered to reach the ground-in dirt and stains left behind by ordinary vacuums. And what\u2019s best of all? It\u2019s as easy as pushing a vacuum! Bring on your deepest clean by first vacuuming the area to be deep cleaned. Next, pre-treat badly stained areas with a specialized pre-treat formula. Continue by filling your clean water tank with hot tap water and the recommended cleaning solution. Then, while pressing the trigger make one slow forward and backward wet pass. To suction the water in your carpet, make these slow forward and backward passes on the same area without pressing the trigger. Repeating this multiple times will help aid in dry time. Once your carpet is dry, vacuum again.Deep cleaning is an effective way to prolong the look of your carpet and upholstery. BISSELL experts recommend deep cleaning at least twice per year and more often if you have children, pets, allergies or smoke.

Plus, some even come with innovative pet-hair features to quickly cleanup pet hair from your furry friends. How hard is it to empty the dirt cup when I see it\u2019s full? BISSELL\u2019s CleanView products allow you to see how much dirt and debris you are collecting so you know when it\u2019s time to empty the dirt cup - and emptying the hand vacuum\u2019s cup is simple and quick. Once the vacuum is unplugged, you just press the release latch down and the dirt container disconnects. Pull the filter away, empty the cup in the trash and you\u2019re done. This design also makes changing the filter easy. Does the Amps mean greater cleaning ability? No. Amps is a measurement of the electrical current used by the motor. Performance depends on a combination of (A) airflow/suction plus (B) brush action to provide (C) cleaning. Therefore, an easy way to remember what is important for good cleaning performance is \u201cA + B = C\u2122\u201d.

Modeled after the original French design, the butter crock is made from durable glazed stoneware or dolomite clays. Available in a wide array of colors, the crock can match existing dinnerware or stand on its own to add a touch of color to the table. It goes from the kitchen to the tabletop with no fuss. Butter's delicate flavor and freshness are protected by an airtight seal of water at the base of the crock, safely keeping butter fresh and spreadable without refrigeration, odors, or spoilage. It also keeps butter at the perfect \"spreading\" consistency by reflecting outside heat while insulating and cooling the butter. To use, firmly pack one stick of softened butter into the bell-shaped lid, pour cold water into the base of the crock, and place the lid upside down back into the base of the crock. Store the crock away from heat or sunlight, and change the water in the base every two to three days. Cleaning is easy since the crock is dishwasher safe. From the Manufacturer  Look how easy it is to use the Butter Bell crock.       1. Pour approximately 1/3 cup very cold water into the base of the crock. 2. Pack \u00bd cup (1 stick) softened butter into the bell-shaped lid. 3. Replace lid into the bottom of the crock. Water creates an airtight seal.  The secret to fresh, creamy butter is the airtight seal.     The unique design keeps butter at the perfect \"spreading\" consistency by reflecting outside heat while insulating and cooling the butter. Flavor and freshness are protected by an airtight seal of water at the base of the crock.  Proper maintenance: Water should be changed out every three days. Replace existing water in the base with fresh, cold water. The crock should be stored away from heat or sunlight.  Holds up to one full stick (1/2 cup) of butter. Softened butter is packed firmly into the bell-shaped lid. Cold water is poured into the base of the crock. The lid is placed upside down back into the base of the crock. Soft, spreadable butter may be enjoyed and served right from the crock.  Frequently Asked Questions:  Why does my butter keep falling into the water or turning moldy?  Though there are many reasons for this, usually once you get the hang of using your Butter Bell, these problems are easily solved. Here are some helpful hints and suggestions to try out:  \u2022 Do not allow the butter to become too soft before packing it into the bell shaped lid. The butter should be firm enough so that is not slipping off the knife before packing the lid. When the butter is slightly firmer it packs into the lid better - just use a little \"elbow grease\".  \u2022 When packing the butter into the bell shaped lid, make sure you press the butter firmly into the lid, removing all air pockets. Air pockets within the butter create a suction affect when the lid is removed from the water, pulling the butter out of the lid.  \u2022 When using your Butter Bell, do not let the \"Bell\" sit out of the crock base for extended periods of time.  \u2022 After each use, check the remaining butter in lid to ensure there aren't any air pockets. Use your knife to redistribute the remaining butter within the lid for better adherence tension.  \u2022 Make sure that the Butter Bell is stored away from sunlight and heat. For instance, do not store on a counter near a stove/oven or in a window sill.  \u2022 Use the coldest water possible when adding water in the base of the crock. Perhaps add a few small, smashed ice cubes if you live in a very warm climate. Make sure you're changing the water every 3 days. This step ensures fresher butter for longer periods of time.  \u2022 Wash thoroughly between uses.  Is the Butter Bell dishwasher safe?  Yes, the Butter Bell is dishwasher safe.  Where is the Butter Bell made and is it safe?  The Butter Bell crocks are made in China, by a top manufacturer of ceramic products. The crocks are made from the highest quality materials and are completely safe, meeting FDA food safety regulatory standards. Each production run of product is tested thoroughly for lead and cadmium levels. Documentation accompanies each shipment, which is submitted to US Customs and the FDA for clearance approval.  Why does my Butter Bell have fine black lines in it?  These fine black lines are called \"crazing.\" This is a normal wear and tear for ceramic products, and happens to plates, dishes, and mugs as well. It will not harm the butter. It is a result of scraping the knife along the sides the bell to get the butter out, as well as dishwashing in very hot water.  Can I use margarine (or other spreads) in the Butter Bell?  The Butter Bell works best when real butter is used. Margarine does not have a spreadability problem. Also, margarines are \"oilier\" and will not stay in the lid very easily. It is not recommended to store other processed spreads in the Butter Bell. Processed spreads (i.e. - cream cheese) need refrigeration to stay fresh for extended periods of time. You can use the Butter Bell for special spreads if you do not plan to store it in the Butter Bell. For example, the Butter Bell might make a great serving piece at an evening dinner party for a special dip or spread that you create.  Can I use whipped butter in the Butter Bell?  Whipped butter is less dense than regular butter. It contains tiny air pockets (hence the fluffiness) which causes the butter to fall into the water. It is not recommended. As well, Ghee or Clarified butters are not recommended for use in the Butter Bell.  Can I store herbal butters in the Butter Bell?  Herbal butters are fine to serve and store in your Butter Bell, however they will not stay fresh as long as pure butter. Butters that contain fresh herbs will stay fresh approximately 5 to 7 days in the Butter Bell. This can vary somewhat so use your best judgment before use.", "salesrank_2018": "32456"}}
