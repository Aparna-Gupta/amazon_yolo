A thoughtful choice for gift giving, the high-quality kitchen items provide sleek designs and convenient functionality for year after year of everyday convenience. Innovative Kitchen-Storage Solutions In the late-1970's, when the gourmet-chef-tools market in the U.S. was still in its infancy, J.K. Adams owner Malcolm Cooper, Sr. conceived of the first slanted knife block. His goal was to create a cutlery organizer that would hold knives at a low enough angle that they could be easily removed from the block when it was pushed back under a cabinet overhang. The J.K. Adams Kangaroo knife block was launched in 1980--the first-ever slanted knife block, and still the best. Recognizing the many opportunities to improve kitchen storage, J.K. Adams introduced the revolving \"carousel\" spice rack in 1982 followed by countless other well-designed storage products in the years since, including the popular in-drawer knife tray in 1994, a space-saving alternative to the knife block that offers the same safety and blade protection. In 2011, J.K. Adams takes cutlery storage to a new level once again with the new Universal knife block. For over 30 years, J.K.

The rich heritage and folklore of the great Yankee Woodworker is as well known today as it was hundreds of years ago, and the craft has been handed down through the generations. J.K.

Do not soak, microwave, freeze, or put in the dishwasher. For removing stains, you can use a weak bleach-and-water solution or a combination of lemon juice and salt. Be sure to rinse and wipe with mineral oil afterward. Additionally, the surface can be sanded to make the board look like new--although a board with wear will add character to your kitchen.

The company has many firsts to its credit, including the first fully automated product of glass blown glass stemware. In the 1990's, as the glass industry struggled with the environmental issues of lead and other heavy metals in crystal, the company was the first glassmaker to produce lead-free crystal glass of superb quality and brilliance. Schott Zwiesel created Tritan Crystal in 2001 by adding titanium oxide and zirconium oxide to develop The World's Best Crystal Glass. Tritan Crystal is 100-percent dishwasher safe-it will not etch, cloud or discolor for the life of the glass. Tritan resists the damages of daily use-breakage, chipping and scratching. Tritan is thermal shock resistant. Tritan is one of the most clear and brilliant crystal, capable of conducting, refracting and transferring light more than any other crystal. Tritan tempers the rim, the bowl and stem joint and the foot edge for added strength against chipping and breakage. All crystal items manufactured by Schott Zwiesel are cut with our patented laser technology for a smooth thin, elegant edge. All stemware products are seamless after manufacturing; no unsightly seams remain between the bowl and stem, on the stem , or under the foot of the glass. Each detail of size, weight and balance is carefully studied by experts in the culinary field and our manufacturing engineers and executes to produce a glass for the maximum pleasure with focus on delivering the wine or spirit to its maximum potential. Pure is the collection when seeking fashion and dramatic styling. Its crisp lines create a geometric modern look. Pure is a full line with every proper stem for your favorite drink.

Push the button and hot water dispenses anytime you wish. This happens because our water boilers not only heat the water, they keep it at optimum temperatures that you can select. Make no mistake; hot water is not just hot water to a discerning tea drinker.

An electric boiler & warmer is a kitchen appliance that keeps water at a constant hot temperature for hot drinks and other culinary uses. You simply fill the boiler with water and plug it in. It boils the water and keeps it at a set temperature all day long. With an electric boiler & warmer, hot water is ready all day at the touch of a button for hot tea, instant coffee and instant noodles. Each model features different hot water temperature settings depending upon your needs. Is there BPA in my Zojirushi water boiler? All Zojirushi products are BPA-free. The inner container of the water boiler is stainless steel with nonstick coating, the inner lid is stainless steel, and both are BPA-free. Some gaskets and the outer lid that may come into contact with water are silicone or plastic, and also do not contain BPA.        What are all those temperatures for? The multiple temperatures can be used for different beverages and foods.

The induction heating method heats the inner cooking pan resulting in exceptionally well-cooked rice. GABA brown cycle activates gamma-aminobutyric acid, a beneficial nutrient in brown rice. 10-cup capacity is great for parties or large families. Note: Capacity is stated in 6-ounce cups of raw rice. Cooked yield is roughly double the amount. Features automatic keep warm and extended keep warm cycle.

Measuring lines on inner cooking pan for precise control of ingredients. Removable inner cooking pan makes clean-up a breeze. Convenient detachable inner lid allows easy washing. Comes with a rice measuring cup and a rice spatula with holder. Menu settings include: white rice, brown rice, sushi rice, mixed rice, and porridge. Make Every Type of Rice Brown Rice This is a menu setting designed to cook delicious brown rice. In order to cook hard rice bran and the rice inside, preheating time is extended for better absorption of water, and is cooked at a lower temperature to allow the rice to cook longer without becoming mushy. Sushi Rice Because sushi rice will be processed after it's cooked, it's easier to handle when it is a little firmer. This menu setting is very similar to regular white rice, but uses less water (adjusted by the water fill lines) for a firm finish. Mixed Rice Mixed rice is rice cooked with additional ingredients and seasonings. This setting extends preheating for better absorption of seasoning. Also, the cooking temperature is slightly lower than regular white rice, to avoid ingredients from boiling over. Porridge Instead of cooking rice in larger amounts of water and risk making it sloppy, use the porridge setting to cook fluffy porridge. Cooking temperature is slightly lower than regular white rice, to be cooked longer for soft texture.  GABA Brown Rice A newly discovered way of cooking brown rice to \"activate\" it and increase natural occurring gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), an amino acid in brown rice believed to have health giving properties such as lowering blood pressure, improving kidney function and relieving stress. The brown rice is \"activated\" by soaking it at 104\u00b0F for 2 hours before the actual cooking begins.

MICOM allows the cooker to have multiple functions on its menu, making it a necessity for any avid rice fan who wants to incorporate rice into her daily diet. The microchip does all the thinking for you by, based on the type of rice you are cooking, from adjusting cooking times, temperatures, and timing the pre-soak of the raw grains to the final \"wait\" period during steaming. Conventional rice cookers simply turn on and off in reaction to temperature. The \"fuzzy logic\" of MICOM fine-tunes this adjustment to adapt to various rice types, such as white, brown, sweet or porridge, which all have different cooking requirements. The trigger to everything is the thermal sensor, a small round button at the bottom of the inner body of the cooker. As the inner pan's weight rests on it and activates the sensor, it starts the cooking process and keeps an eye on the temperature and time. Induction Heating (IH) system for precise temperature control Induction Heating took rice cooking to another level by introducing another dimension to the heating process. Where the heating element would normally be located at the bottom of the cooker, IH transforms the entire inner cooking pan into a heat conductor, allowing for higher, more precise and more uniform cooking temperatures. Induction heating occurs when a magnetic material enters a magnetic field. This is recreated by passing an electric current through coils located at the bottom of the rice cooker's body. As the special, 2-ply inner cooking pan is placed inside, a magnetic field is created, which in turn generates instant heat. The entire cooking pan becomes the heat source, with the ability to cook at higher temperatures, which can be turned on and off instantly for greater control.

Due to this uniqueness, there may be slight variations from piece to piece. Le Creuset Stoneware is safe for use in the microwave, freezer, refrigerator, dishwasher, oven and broiler. The maximum oven-safe temperature is 500 degrees F / 260 degrees C. The enameled surface is easy to clean and scratch-resistant. The enamel is completely hygienic and will not absorb odors or flavors. Le Creuset Stoneware is extremely strong and durable, and resists staining, chipping and cracking. The handles, knobs and rims have been designed for a secure, easy-to-hold grip. Cleaning and Care DO NOT use any Stoneware piece on the stovetop or any other direct heat source. OVEN: Maximum oven-safe temperature is 500 degrees F / 260 degrees C. Use oven mitts for lifting at all times. BROILER: When using under a broiler allow a gap of no less than 2-1/2 inches between the rim of the dish and the heat source. MICROWAVE: Handles may become hot during prolonged microwave use, especially if the handles are enclosed with plastic wrap. Cover just the open top of the dish, leaving the handles exposed. FREEZER-TO-OVEN USE: Do not place a frozen dish of food in a preheated oven. Place the frozen dish in a cold oven and set the temperature, allowing the dish and oven to heat together. Before serving always check that the center of the food is completely and uniformly hot. CLEANING: Before the first use, wash the dish in hot, soapy water, and rinse and dry thoroughly. For most day-to-day cleaning, cool the dish for a few minutes before washing and drying, or wash in the dishwasher, allowing the full cycle to complete. Never leave a dish fully immersed in water. For removal of stubborn residues allow the dish to cool, fill with warm, soapy water and allow it to soak for 10 to 20 minutes.

Recipe Tips and Hints    \u2022 Many family favorites can be easily adapted for preparation in your Cuisinart Electric Pressure Cooker \u2013 soups, stews, side dishes and more.  \u2022 The amount of liquid needed is much less than for traditional cooking methods.  \u2022 Never exceed the Maximum Fill Amount of the pressure cooker.  \u2022 Make sure the lid is on firmly and tightly, and moved as far counterclockwise as it will go to allow proper locking.  \u2022 Hot foods/liquids will come to pressure more quickly than cold foods/liquids.  \u2022 When pressure cooking is completed, follow recipe instructions for releasing pressure. For Quick Pressure Release it is important to begin immediately upon completion of pressure cooking; otherwise foods will continue to cook, and may overcook.  \u2022 Do not store pressure cooker with lid on tightly. This saves on gasket wear and tear.  \u2022 More nutrients are preserved during pressure cooking than with traditional cooking methods, as less liquid is used and thus fewer nutrients are lost to evaporation.  \u2022 To adapt your own recipes, find a similar one in our cookbook and use it as a guide. In general, cooking time will be at least 1\u20443 to . of the traditional cooking time. Reduce your cooking liquid by at least half \u2013 you may need to \"play\" with your recipe to get it right. You may wish to add vegetables at the end of cooking to avoid overcooking. You can also use the cooking charts provided as a guide.

Its large, 5-1/2-quart, stainless-steel bowl accommodates big batches--even double recipes. The unit also provides 12 mixing speeds, along with a 15-minute countdown timer and automatic shutoff, for maximum precision. Choose the slow-start function to eliminate splatter or the ultra-gentle fold function to carefully blend in delicate ingredients. The mixer's tilt-back head allows for easy access to the mixing bowl and makes attaching accessories simple. Accessories include a chef's whisk, a flat mixing paddle and a dough hook, as well as a splashguard. The whisk aerates ingredients to increase volume or can also be used on slow speed to gently combine dry ingredients. Contoured to reach the bottom and sides of the bowl, the flat mixing paddle ensures thorough mixing. The dough hook makes hand kneading obsolete, while the splashguard offers an extra-wide pouring spout for easily adding ingredients. The stand mixer also contains three power outlets, including a high-speed outlet for its optional dedicated attachments (meat grinder, citrus juicer, blender, food processor, or pasta maker--all sold separately). The stand mixer measures 15-1/2 by 10 by 12-1/2 Inch and carries a three-year product warranty and a five-year motor warranty. From the Manufacturer More than 30 years ago Cuisinart changed the way the world cooked. Now it's changing the way the world mixes with the Cuisinart stand mixer. The new extra-large Cuisinart 5-quart mixer has the power, capacity and precision to handle any job a recipe requires and delivers more power to mix even the heaviest dough. There\u2019s also more capacity to double and triple recipes. The mixer comes with three accessories, allowing you to mix, whip, or even knead dough. It has 12 speeds to ensure splatter-free starts and fabulous finishes. In addition, Cuisinart offers optional attachments that can be purchased separately. Each attachment connects to one of the three power outlets on the mixer (two on the top and one on the front) to let you blend, process food, squeeze juice from your favorite citrus fruits, make homemade pasta, or grind your own meats. Multiple Outlets Mean More Functionality High-speed power outlet for the blender and food processor attachment (sold separately), which connects to the rear power outlet on top of the stand mixer. Mid-speed power outlet for the citrus juicer attachment (sold separately), which connects to the front power outlet on the top of the stand mixer. Slow-speed power outlet for the large meat grinder and the pasta-maker attachments (sold separately), which connect to the power outlet behind the slow-speed outlet cover on the front of the stand mixer head. An Array of Helpful Features The mixer's tilt-back head securely locks the stand mixer into a raised position, which allows easy access to the 5-quart mixing bowl and makes it easy to attach accessories. The stainless-steel bowl includes handles, which makes the bowl easy to hold, scrape and remove and it's oversized to let you mix larger quantities. The mixer has a handy 15-minute countdown timer, plus a slow-start function that eliminates splatter for the most delicate ingredients. The fold function allows you to mix in ingredients at the lowest speed with two options--continuous, to blend ingredients and pulse, to combine ingredients. Each pulse generates 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 revolutions of the flat mixing paddle, chef's whisk, or dough hook. The flat mixing paddle, dough hook, or chef's whisk spins independently while rotating around the mixing bowl for the quickest, most thorough results.

The stainless steel Cuisinart Espresso Maker is the real thing and looks like the professional it is. Make espresso in your own kitchen, then use the stainless steam nozzle and frothing cup to turn it into cappuccino or latte. You can even heat the cups on the warming plate on top-just like the pros! 15 bars of pressure guarantee perfect results!  From the Manufacturer   The Cuisinart EM-100 Espresso Maker   The Cuisinart EM-100 espresso maker  Cuisinart lets you prepare gourmet quality espresso at home! With a system that allows you to pre-select serving size, 15 bars of pressure for maximum flavor and the option of using ground espresso or pods, you're in control. A separate steam function and stainless steel nozzle make it easy to froth milk for cappuccinos and smooth lattes. With a removable drip tray and cover, and a filter holder with a locking mechanism clean up is quick and easy. The Quest for a Perfect Espresso It is generally agreed that there are four basic elements critical to the perfect cup:  Element 1: WATER When brewing espresso, make sure the water flows through the filter at the correct pace. The water flow can be adjusted by varying the pressure with which the coffee is taped in the filter or by altering the grind of coffee. If the speed of the water is slow the coffee will be over extracted and will be very dark and bitter, with a spotted and uneven creme (froth) on the top. If the speed of the water flow is too fast, the coffee will be under-extracted and the supreme flavor will not develop. The coffee will be diluted and there will be an inadequate amount of cr\u00e8me on the top. Element 2: COFFEE While the bulk of the liquid is water, all of the flavor should be from the coffee. To achieve the same great quality of coffee you receive at a cafe, you need to use the same quality beans. If you choose to grind your own beans, buy the beans fresh and whole, only about a two week supply at a time for maximum freshness. Once the coffee bean is broken, its flavor degrades very quickly. If it is not practical to buy smaller supplies, we recommend you separate larger amounts of beans and store them in airtight containers in a cool, dry area. They should not be kept for longer than 1 month as flavor will diminish. Do not refrigerate or freeze coffee beans. Element 3: GRIND The grind of the coffee is critical for proper flavor extraction. If using a pre-ground coffee, be sure to purchase an espresso grind that is specifically for espresso/cappuccino machines. If the grind is too fine, over extraction and bitterness will occur with a spotted and uneven crema on top. If the grind is too coarse, the water will pass through too rapidly and there will be an inadequate amount of crema on the top of the espresso. Element 4: TAMPING THE COFFEE GROUNDS If you choose to use ground espresso instead of pods, tamping the coffee is a very important part of the coffee making process. Use the scoop supplied to fill the filter basket, then using the tamping tool, tamp down the grounds with moderate pressure. Add more coffee and tamp again if necessary to bring coffee to level. Do not overfill the filter basket. The ground coffee should be tamped with moderate pressure. If the coffee is not tamped securely, there is a chance the water will flow through the coffee to rapidly and the coffee will be under-extracted. Note: if the coffee is tamped too firmly, the water will flow through the coffee too slowly and the coffee will be over-extracted.   The combination coffee scoop/tamping tool.

Measuring scoop/tamping tool: Use one side as a coffee scoop and the other to compact the coffee grounds in the filter basket prior to brewing. Filter baskets: Use the one cup filter for a single espresso and the two cup filter basket for the double espresso, and the pod filter basket for espresso pods.  Guide to the Perfect Espresso  You may want to preheat the cups by filling them with hot water; this will help preserve the crema of the espresso. Set the cups aside. Select the appropriate filter basket and insert it in the portafilter handle.  Using the measuring scoop place finely ground coffee in the filter basket holder. Use one scoop for one cup and two scoops for two cups, or place espresso pod into filter basket holder. Rest the portafilter handle with the filter basket in position on the countertop. Using the tamping tool, apply moderate packing pressure. Add more coffee and tamp again if necessary to bring coffee to level. Brush any excess grounds form around the edge of the filter basket. Secure the portafilter holder onto the brew head. Check to see if the espresso machine is ready for use. Remember that if the heating light is on, the espresso machine is still adjusting the temperature of the heating system. Turn the function knob clockwise to the picture of the cup espresso setting to start the pour and turn it back to the off position to stop. Check the espresso pour and serve immediately.    Milk steaming wand.  Guide to Milk Texturing Milk texturing is the steaming of milk. The steam does two things: it heats the milk and mixes air with the milk to form a creamy texture. As with learning to make an espresso, perfecting the art of milk texturing takes time and practice. Easy to follow steps are outlined in the Instruction Booklet. Using the Hot Water Function When using the hot water function make sure that the steam/hot water knob is in the double drip hot water setting. Place the cup or container under the steam/hot water nozzle and turn the function knob to the steam/hot water setting. Once you have dispensed the required amount, stop the hot water by turning the function knob to the off position. Remove the cup or container and swing the steam/hot water wand over the drip tray to catch any drips of water.

Coffee is brewed by placing the coffee and water together, leaving to brew for a few minutes, then depressing the plunger to trap the coffee grinds at the bottom of the glass jug. A French press equires coffee of a more coarse grind than that used for a drip brew coffee filter, such as produced by a burr mill grinder rather than the whirling blade variety, as a finer grind will seep through the press filter and into the coffee. Because the coffee grounds remain in direct contact with the brewing water and the grinds are filtered from the water via a mesh instead of a paper filter, coffee brewed with the French press captures more of the coffee's flavour and essential oils, which would become trapped in a traditional drip brew machine's paper filters.

The Wusthof factory history goes back as far as 1814 when the company was listed with the Duchy of Berg. To this day, the company remains family owned. A considerable number of separate manufacturing steps are required to complete each precision forged knife. Each step is performed to exacting standards by skilled German workers aided by the most modern, computer guided equipment. It is this balance of German technology and old-world hand-craftsmanship that is the secret of how each Wusthof knife is created. Known the internationally for it's unique and uncompromising quality, Wusthof uses a special blend of German steel through out the whole length of the knife. The ingredients of this steel are proudly etched on each blade. Wusthof not only uses the best materials to make a fine knife, but it is also crucial that each blade is precisely tempered. This tempering allows the knife to hold its edge for an extremely long time, yet still be able to be maintained in your home kitchen with out the need to be sent away for maintenance.

Safety and practicality were the guiding principles during the development process, and our little Kettle came complete with an innovative steam shield.  Through user feedback, we realized we missed a key consumer insight - that a Tea Kettle, while a practical kitchen tool, is often a centerpiece in the kitchen. Users would leave them out on the stovetop when not in use and some even coordinated their entire kitchen decor around their Kettles. While the steam shield was innovative, it was considered by many to be unsightly.  In 1998, we corrected the aesthetic flaws to our otherwise safe, practical and well-performing Kettle with the Uplift. The kicker is that all of its elegant aesthetics came as a direct result of making the Uplift safe and easy to use. Problems Identified  Handles on tea kettles are positioned too close to the steam and hot water at the spout, making it uncomfortable while pouring Angle of kettle handles combined with weight of filled kettle make it difficult for users to lift and pour without straining wrists Fine motor skills required to open kettle trigger to pour hot water; difficult for many older users to maneuver Small opening on top makes it difficult to clean interior of kettle  The Process  The quest for the perfect interaction point between the spout and the handle (so the kettle would not open when carried around filled with water, but would open easily when tipped forward) led us to the current connection between the spout and handle, one that resembles a splash of water. The same connection point was also designed to keep the spout open if the user chose, so that they could keep the Uplift's whistle quiet while boiling water, which is especially handy when preparing an early morning cup of tea. While designing an opening large enough to be easy to clean, we needed to ensure it wasn't so low as to limit the maximum water level, but we still needed to keep it in balance with the spout for aesthetic reasons. Through user research, we learned that steam would sometimes escape from the lid and unfortunately heat the handle, so we added a silicone seal to minimize any unintended heat transfer and keep the kettle safe and easy to use.  OXO's Solutions  Large, comfortable handle is angled away from the spout and is heat resistant and non-slip, even when wet Handle angle allows user to hold Kettle comfortably and without wrist strain, whether filled with water or nearly empty, by adjusting grip accordingly Whistle spout opens automatically when Kettle is tipped to pour - no awkward buttons or levers to press Wide opening on top of Kettle enables easy access for cleaning and can also be used as an opening to fill Kettle  The OXO Story In 1990, OXO staged a revolution (of sorts) by offering an easy-to-use, high-performing alternative to uncomfortable and ineffective kitchen gadgets. OXO's innovative take on the traditional Swivel Peeler, complete with its pudgy black handle, raised consumers' expectations of what could be expected from household products.  Today OXO offers over 800 products, each developed with a close (some might say \"obsessive\") attention to detail. Our goal is to deliver products that maximize comfort AND performance, illustrating our mission to create innovative consumer products that make everyday living easier.  Ever wonder what makes an OXO product an \"OXO Product\"? OXO employees believe there are two rules that should guide product development: First, every new product must deliver a significant improvement over the status quo. Second, the functionality should never be sacrificed to make the product more attractive - above all it should work well.

However as soon as you start to use the machine the bag starts to fill with dust and debris. The bag acts as a filter and the machine starts to lose suction. This is because the pores of the bag begin to clog with the dust that the machine has picked up. This restricts the airflow which causes loss of suction power. Other Bagless Systems Clog like Bags  When the vacuum cleaner is new, clean air flows through the container and out through the filters. However as soon as you start to use the machine the container starts to fill with dust and debris. The filters clog, and the machine starts to lose suction. This is because the surface of the filter becomes blocked with dust, restricting the airflow which causes a loss of suction power.  Only Dyson Doesn't Lose SuctionDyson Root Cyclone technology uses 200,000G of centrifugal force in the cyclones to filter dust and remove dirt from the airflow efficiently. Because there is nothing to obstruct the airflow, it doesn't clog and doesn't lose suction.\u00a0  Dyson proves no loss of suction claim using the IEC 60312 Cl 2.9 test standard.  Dyson has the Most Advanced Cyclone Technology         Powerful suction spins out larger dirt and debris.    The shroud filters out fluff and lint.    Centrifugal forces spin out the tiny harmful particles.    Cleaner air is expelled into your home.       The Dyson Story  James Dyson You know the feeling when some everyday product lets you down. You wish someone could solve the problem. James Dyson does that. He is a man who likes to make things work better. With his research team he has developed products that have achieved sales of over $10 billion worldwide. The Bag ProblemIn 1978, while vacuuming his home, James Dyson realized his bag vacuum cleaner was constantly losing suction power. He noticed how dust quickly clogged the pores of the bag and blocked the airflow, so that suction dropped rapidly. He set to work to solve this problem. 5 years and 5,127 prototypes later, the world's first cyclonic bagless vacuum cleaner arrived. No Place for New TechnologyJames Dyson offered his invention to major manufacturers. One by one they turned him down, apparently not interested in new technology. They seemed determined to continue selling bags, worth $500 million every year. Later, Hoover's Vice President for Europe, Mike Rutter, said on UK national TV: \"I do regret that Hoover as a company did not take the product technology off Dyson; it would have lain on the shelf and not been used\".", "salesrank_2018": "5017551"}, "B000NDQ3DC": {"description": "Oneida's Chateau is charming, classic and collectible.

Why Buy Shun Classic: Born of the ancient samurai-sword-making tradition and hand-finished for precision and beauty, Shun Classic is an ideal choice for anyone buying their first Japanese knife or 50th. The high-quality line of cutlery makes a worthwhile addition to any chef's arsenal of tools--it's used by professional chefs and home cooks alike. Produced in the widest variety of specialized styles, the Classic line features both traditional European blade shapes and innovative cutting-edge designs. Shun Classic's amazingly sharp blade is famous for both edge retention and ease of sharpening. Each blade has a core of VG-10 \"Super Steel\" with a Pattern Damascus cladding of 32 layers of high-carbon stainless steel--16 layers on either side. While the wood grain pattern enhances the knife's beauty, it also adds durability and stain resistance, and reduces friction when cutting. NSF certified for use in commercial kitchens. Detailed Features  Blade core consists of high-carbon VG-10, a Japanese super steel known for its edge retention, allowing the knives to hold their sharp edges for years. Blades boast a 16-degree angle, making these the sharpest knives out of the box. This is sharper than traditional European blades, which are usually sharpened to 20-22 degrees. Clad with 16 layers of SUS410/SUS431 Pattern Damascus stainless steel on each side for strength and flexibility. This metal is corrosion-resistant and easy to maintain. Damascus styling adds to the beauty of the knife while the microscopic air pockets created by the cladding process reduces friction during slicing. D-shaped handle fits in the palm and provides comfort and control, keeping the knife's handle secure in the hand during use. Available standard in D-shaped handle styles or by special order in reverse D-shaped handle styles. Pakkawood handles, made of resin-impregnated hardwood, are NSF Certified for use in commercial kitchens. Produced in Seki City, Japan, the capital of samurai sword manufacturing. Rockwell hardness rating of 60-61 ensures that it takes and holds its incredibly sharp edge longer. Hand wash and dry recommended; limited lifetime warranty.    Specifications   Blade Material: VG-10 hardened Japanese steel cutting core, clad with 16 layers of SUS410/SUS431 Pattern Damascus stainless steel on each side, for a total of 33 layers of metal.   Bevel: Double-beveled   Cutting angle: 16 degrees per side (comprehensive angle 32 degrees). This is sharper than European knives, ground to 20-22 degrees per side.    Handle Material: PakkaWood (resin-impregnated hardwood); D-Shaped handle available in right and (by special order) left-handed versions.

For that reason, when vacuuming carpet fresheners or cleaners, powder, plaster dust or similar fine substances, the dust cup and filter may need cleaning more often.  \u2022 Use the cleaner to pick up dirt and dust particles. Avoid picking up hard or sharp objects that could damage the vacuum cleaner. Easy Cleaning Steps  Pull the crevice tool out.  Place the crevice tool on the end of the vacuum head.  When cleaning is completed, store crevice tool back. Remove dust cup filter and dump dust cup in a waste container.  The filter can be cleaned by brushing off over a waste container.  The dust cup can be rinsed under running water and should be completely dried before replacing on cleaner.

The unit's 15 bars of pressure deliver consistently authentic espresso with excellent crema, while its stainless-steel steam nozzle makes it easy to turn an espresso drink into a frothy cappuccino or latte. Pre-programmed cup sizes include 1-1/2 ounces and 3 ounces. The espresso maker's 64-ounce reservoir removes for easy filling, and its steam button functions separately for convenience. Other highlights include a cup-warming tray on top, a removable drip tray and cover for easy cleanup, and a porta-filter holder with a locking mechanism, which makes it possible to quickly pump out wet grounds after each use. Accessories include a stainless frothing cup and a tamping tool with a measuring spoon. Beautifully designed in professional stainless-steel housing with an embossed Cuisinart logo, the espresso maker measures 10-1/2 by 9-1/4 by 12-3/4 inches and carries a three-year limited warranty. From the Manufacturer       With the EM-200, Cuisinart lets you prepare gourmet quality espresso at home. With a programmable system that allows you to pre-select serving size, 15 bars of pressure for maximum flavor, and the option of using ground espresso or pods, you\u2019re in control. A separate steam function and stainless steel nozzle make it easy to froth milk for cappuccinos and smooth lattes. With a removable drip tray and cover, and a portafilter holder with a locking mechanism that makes it easy to dispose of wet grounds after use, clean up is also quick and simple.    The Quest for a Perfect Espresso       It is generally agreed that there are four basic elements critical to the perfect cup: Water: When brewing espresso, make sure the water flows through the filter at the correct pace. The water flow can be adjusted by varying the pressure with which the coffee is tamped in the filter or by altering the grind of coffee. If the speed of the water is slow, the coffee will be over extracted and will be very dark and bitter, with a spotted and uneven crema (froth) on the top. If the speed of the water flow is too fast, the coffee will be under-extracted and the supreme flavor will not develop. The coffee will be diluted and there will be an inadequate amount of crema on the top. Coffee: While the bulk of the liquid is water, all of the flavor should be from the coffee. To achieve the same great quality of coffee you receive at a cafe, you need to use the same quality beans. If you choose to grind your own beans, buy the beans fresh and whole, only about a two week supply at a time for maximum freshness. Once the coffee bean is broken, its flavor degrades very quickly. If it is not practical to buy smaller supplies, we recommend you separate larger amounts of beans and store them in airtight containers in a cool, dry area. They should not be kept for longer than 1 month as flavor will diminish. Do not refrigerate or freeze coffee beans. Grind: The grind of the coffee is critical for proper flavor extraction. If using a pre-ground coffee, be sure to purchase an espresso grind that is specifically for espresso/cappuccino machines. If the grind is too fine, over extraction and bitterness will occur with a spotted and uneven crema on top. If the grind is too coarse, the water will pass through too rapidly and there will be an inadequate amount of crema on the top of the espresso. Tamping the Coffee Grounds: If you choose to use ground espresso instead of pods, tamping the coffee is a very important part of the coffee-making process. Use the scoop supplied to fill the filter basket, then using the tamping tool, tamp down the grounds with moderate pressure. Add more coffee and tamp again if necessary to bring coffee to level. Do not overfill the filter basket. The ground coffee should be tamped with moderate pressure. If the coffee is not tamped securely, there is a chance the water will flow through the coffee to rapidly and the coffee will be under-extracted. Note: if the coffee is tamped too firmly, the water will flow through the coffee too slowly and the coffee will be over-extracted.   Programming Your Espresso Machine This Cuisinart espresso machine has programming capabilities. Based on cafe settings, the single and the double espresso functions are set to 1.5 and 3 ounce. However, by following a few simple steps, you can pre-program your perfect serving size down to the ounce. Easy to follow steps with illustrations are included in the Instruction Book.  Milk Texturing Milk texturing is the steaming of milk. The steam does two things; its heats the milk and mixes the air with the milk for form a foamy texture. As with learning to make an espresso, perfecting the art of milk texturing takes time and practice.     Features and Benefits  Removable 64-ounce water reservoir with lid with 2 options for filling with water:Lift the lid at the top of the espresso maker and fill with cold or filtered water.Remove the reservoir to fill and then replace by pushing down firmly until the reservoir sets on the base flush with the unit.Cup-warming plate for warming espresso cups 15-bar pump Manual Button: Used for a continuous pour of espresso 1-Cup Button: Used for a single serving of espresso, 1.5 ounces 2-Cup Button: Used for a double serving of espresso, 3 ounces Program Button: Used to set the number of ounces needed Steam Button: Used when making cappuccinos and lattes--will flash until ready for use.

Most kitchens in Asia do not have ovens, therefore baking or roasting are not commonly used cooking techniques. Instead, dumplings, breads, cakes, and other desserts are steamed. There are also wonderful soups and meat dishes and superb fish and seafood specialties that are cooked to perfection in the gentle, moist heat of a steamer. Steaming is also a perfect way to refresh stale bread and reheat leftovers. Steaming has gained popularity in the Western kitchen for its convenience, simplicity, health benefits and energy savings. Steaming envelopes the food in a hot, moist environment so it won\u2019t dry out. And unlike boiling, natural juices, minerals and vitamins as well as color in foods are retained and not drained out in the sink. Steaming is also a very low fat way to cook because you need very little or no oils. Food should not be placed directly in the bamboo steamer without a plate (if the food is marinated, such as fish and meat) or parchment liner (if food is dry, such as buns and dumplings) and allow at least 1- inch space between the sides of the plate and the sides of the steamer. The beauty of bamboo steamers extends from their aesthetics to their practicality. The bamboo lid is double woven so that steam is trapped inside the steamer to cook quickly and efficiently with little heat loss. The lid also absorbs any condensation from steaming, controlling condensation is especially important when steaming breads, dumplings and cakes which can be ruined from excess moisture. The steamer is so attractive; it can be brought right to the table for serving. It will also help to keep foods hot during the meal. Helen\u2019s Asian Kitchen steamers are strong, durable and constructed completely of natural bamboo with bamboo pegs and bamboo lacing for strength, durability and beauty.

Its extra-large, 7-quart, stainless-steel bowl accommodates big batches--even double or triple recipes. The unit also provides 12 mixing speeds, along with a 15-minute countdown timer and automatic shutoff, for maximum precision. Choose the slow-start function to eliminate splatter or the ultra-gentle fold function to carefully blend in delicate ingredients. The mixer's tilt-back head allows for easy access to the mixing bowl and makes attaching accessories simple. Accessories include a chef's whisk, a flat mixing paddle, and a dough hook, as well as a splashguard. The whisk aerates ingredients to increase volume or can also be used on slow speed to gently combine dry ingredients. Contoured to reach the bottom and sides of the bowl, the flat mixing paddle ensures thorough mixing. The dough hook makes hand kneading obsolete, while the splashguard offers an extra-wide pouring spout for easily adding ingredients. The stand mixer also contains three power outlets, including a high-speed outlet for its optional dedicated attachments (meat grinder, citrus juicer, blender, food processor, or pasta maker--all sold separately). The stand mixer measures 15-1/2 by 11 by 14-1/2 inches and carries a three-year product warranty and a five-year motor warranty.  From the Manufacturer      More than 30 years ago Cuisinart changed the way the world cooked. Now it's changing the way the world mixes with the Cuisinart stand mixer. The new extra-large Cuisinart 7-quart mixer has the power, capacity, and precision to handle any job a recipe requires and delivers more power to mix even the heaviest dough. There\u2019s also more capacity to double and triple recipes. The mixer comes with three accessories, allowing you to mix, whip, or even knead dough. It has 12 speeds to ensure splatter-free starts and fabulous finishes. In addition, Cuisinart offers optional attachments that can be purchased separately. Each attachment connects to one of the three power outlets on the mixer (two on the top and one on the front) to let you blend, process food, squeeze juice from your favorite citrus fruits, make homemade pasta, or grind your own meats.   Multiple Outlets Mean More Functionality    High-speed power outlet for the blender and food processor attachment (sold separately), which connects to the rear power outlet on top of the stand mixer. Mid-speed power outlet for the citrus juicer attachment (sold separately), which connects to the front power outlet on the top of the stand mixer. Slow-speed power outlet for the large meat grinder and the pasta-maker attachments (sold separately), which connect to the power outlet behind the slow-speed outlet cover on the front of the stand mixer head.      An Array of Helpful Features    The mixer's tilt-back head securely locks the stand mixer into a raised position, which allows easy access to the 7-quart mixing bowl and makes it easy to attach accessories. The stainless-steel bowl includes handles, which makes the bowl easy to hold, scrape, and remove, and it's oversized to let you mix larger quantities.  The mixer has a handy 15-minute countdown timer as well as a slow-start function that eliminates splatter for the most delicate ingredients. The fold function allows you to mix in ingredients at the lowest speed with two options--continuous, to blend ingredients, and pulse, to combine ingredients. Each pulse generates 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 revolutions of the flat mixing paddle, chef's whisk, or dough hook. The flat mixing paddle, dough hook, or chef's whisk spins independently while rotating around the mixing bowl for the quickest, most thorough results.

The 1.6-cubic-foot unit with its 15-inch turntable perfectly cooks and evenly heats anything from breakfast foods and after-school snacks to dinnertime meals and appetizers when entertaining. Ideal for busy professionals and on-the-go families, the microwave oven provides quick and easy meal preparation while nicely accommodating and enhancing surrounding decor.   Create savory stews and other meals with ease.    Iluminated neon-blue spin dial for easy programming.    The countertop microwave can be installed in the wall using an optional matching trim kit.(Trim kit shown may not represent actual trim kit.)  Inverter Technology Moving Beyond Just \"Heating Things Up\" Many people just use their microwaves for making popcorn or warming up soup because most microwaves just have one temperature setting--high. Conventional microwave ovens might have a low-power setting, but this is achieved by \"pulsing\" the high-power setting on and off rather than by emitting a steady stream of low-powered energy. Panasonic's trailblazing Inverter technology delivers true, variable microwave power, which means even temperatures and consistent textures throughout the food being cooked. The consistent delivery of microwave energy allows delicate foods to simmer without the edges and surfaces overcooking, so foods have the look and taste you expect--without the wait. The Inverter microwave oven perfects the art of cooking, taking microwave cooking to a whole new level. You'll experience delicious food that better retains its color, nutrients, and flavor and that's easier and faster to prepare. Oh, and you can still make great popcorn.  Single, Compact Power Supply Furthermore, the Inverter power unit is smaller and lighter than conventional microwave circuitry (aka the heavy, enclosed side of the microwave), which allows for more interior space to fit that favorite casserole dish, without increasing the oven's overall exterior dimensions. Weighing just over 31 pounds, the oven's roomy interior measures 18-1/2 inches long by 16-7/16 inches wide by 9 inches high, while its compact exterior measures 19-7/16 inches long by 21-7/8 inches wide by 12 inches high.  Additional Features  One-Touch Genius Sensor Cook and Reheat With the touch of Panasonic's Sensor Cooking button, the microwave takes the guesswork out of creating a great meal, by automatically setting power levels and adjusting cooking or defrosting time. The sensor measures the amount of steam produced during cooking, and signals the microprocessor to calculate the remaining cooking time at the appropriate power level automatically. Inverter Turbo Defrost Panasonic evolved the Turbo Defrost feature, which allows you to defrost foods even faster than previous Panasonic Auto Defrost. Panasonic Inverter Turbo Defrost technology is an advanced microwave sequencing system using the inverter continuous-power delivery method.   Menu Action Screen (multi-lingual) The Menu Action Screen is like having a chef to assist you in the kitchen. It scrolls step-by-step cooking instructions across the display, in a choice of English, Spanish, or French. Keep Warm Feature A pulsing delivery of very low microwave power keeps food temperatures at a constant level--without overcooking. So, foods like stew, gravy, and desserts remain warm in the oven for up to 30 minutes after cooking. Clock/Timer Time-of-day clock and versatile timer provide exceptional convenience.   Quick Minute The one-touch button allows you to set or add cooking time in 1-minute increments up to 10 minutes. Control Panel with Blue LED Dial Ring/Blue Backlit Display The silver button control panel, illuminated neon-blue spin dial, and generous six-digit expanded backlit display provide a high-end look and a practically effortless navigation experience in the kitchen. Child-Safety Lock For safety, the oven's child safety lock prevents electronic operation (door still opens). Press Start three times to lock (\"Lock\" will display); press Stop/Reset three times to cancel.     Push-button controls, illuminated dial, and backlit display for ease of use.

Wool fibers have a natural crimp with a built-in \"memory\" which returns the fibers to their original shape after compression. This means that a wool-filled comforter will remain soft and fluffy. And unlike down which can shift into corners or form lumps, wool forms a natural batting so this comforter will not loose its shape, form lumps, or shift. The sewn-through end to end construction further ensures the comforter will retain its shape, eliminating cold spots. Wool's natural absorbency wicks away perspiration and releases its slowly though evaporation leaving you feeling less chilled in winter and comfortably cooled during the summer. In addition, wool-fill retains small amounts of lanolin, making it naturally resistant to dust mites.
