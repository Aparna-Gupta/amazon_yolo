We take great pride not only in the outstanding quality of our products but also in the environment in which they are made. Every product that bears our name was made in an ethically and socially responsible way.  About our Bamboo Bamboo is one of the most remarkable resources on Earth. As a member of the grass family, not a tree, it grows at a much quicker rate than any other wood. From start to harvest (60-70 feet tall) it can take just four years. Bamboo is also one of the lightest materials available. Bamboo is 16% stronger than Maple and is 33% lighter in weight than oak. What is probably most remarkable is its unique extensive root system. When bamboo is harvested its natural root system spreads and automatically regenerates itself. Virtually all of the bamboo we harvest is used in the process. When we harvest the bamboo stalk at 70 feet it is cut up and divided into different production materials. The bottom section is primarily used for flooring and building materials. These are usually the toughest and hardest pieces to bend. The middle section is used by our factories to make lovely handcrafted products ranging from our assorted boards to versatile bowls and everything in between. The top section is used for smaller thinner items such as chop sticks, and accessory items. Even the sawdust created during the cutting is collected and mixed in with other materials to create a concrete like substance used for building and fixing a variety of items. Eco-Friendly FSC CertifiedSocially Responsible Bamboo is a 100% renewable resource which does not need re-planting, extensive irrigation, pesticides or fertilizer. When bamboo is harvested its natural root system spreads and automatically regenerates itself. . FDA ApprovedPanda SafeFDA Approved All of our bamboo products are certified by the Food and Drug Administration to be safe for use for food. We have designed our collection of bamboo products to be used for food preparation and presentation, from our cutting boards and utensils, to our beautiful serving bowls and trays. Enjoy using our products to prep and serve all of your favorite cuisines. FSC Certified All of our products are certified by the FSC. The Forest Stewardship Council protects and ensures that products with the FSC label uphold principles and criteria which bring the highest social and environmental benefits during harvesting. This brings direct benefits to the forests from which we harvest our bamboo, including protecting biodiversity, worker's rights, and areas that have environmental or cultural significance.  Bacterial Fighting Pan FriendlyPanda Safe The species of bamboo used in the production of our products is not a food source or a habitat for the Giant Panda. There are many types of bamboo that pandas eat, and we proudly use bamboo that does not impact the livelihood of this wonderful animal. Natural Bacterial Fighting Properties Scientists found that bamboo has a unique anti-bacterial bio-agent known as \\\"bamboo Kun\\\" which allows bamboo to thrive naturally in the wild without any pesticide. Pot and Pan Friendly Bamboo is the perfect material for food preparation. It is 16% stronger than Maple and 33% lighter in weight than oak. This substantial, yet light-weight material won't scratch your pots and pans. Care and use We recommend that our bamboo products are hand washed with light soap and warm water and periodically coated with mineral oil to bring out the beautiful grain of the bamboo.

We can't stand the status quo\u2014especially when the status quo stinks. That was literally true back in 1982, when you had two options for getting garlic into your meal: chop up a fresh clove and have your hands smell for the rest of the day, or settle for a couple of thin, dry flakes tapped out of a plastic container. For our founder, CEO, and Famous Inventor David Holcomb, there really was no option. He had to do better, and he knew he could. Fast forward a few decades and David's first creation, the Garlic Machine, has become Chef'n. We're a growing Seattle-based company with more than 250 product patents worldwide and a single mission. We want to make better tools so you can make better food. It's what drives our in-house design team to reinvent the utensils and gadgets that most of us take for granted while we're cooking and cleaning. It's what attracts the terrific, talented people we've welcomed into our Chef'n family. And it's what compels us to tell everyone we meet about the innovation Chef'n products can bring to their kitchens. Is anyone listening? Well, the design awards and magazine covers seem to say yes, but for us the true test is in the homes of real people around the world. So put one of our inventions to work, create something delicious, and we look forward to hearing from you about your Chef'n experience.

Freezing Time and Bowl Preparation The freezer bowl must be completely frozen before you begin your recipe. Before freezing, wash and dry the bowl. The length of time needed to reach the frozen state depends on how cold your freezer is. It is recommended that you place the freezer bowl in the back of your freezer where it is the coldest. Be sure to place the freezer bowl on a flat surface in its upright position for even freezing. Generally, freezing time is between 16 hours and 24 hours. Shake the bowl to determine whether it is completely frozen. If you do not hear the liquid within the bowl moving, the cooling liquid is therefore frozen. For the most convenient frozen desserts and drinks, leave your freezer bowl in the freezer at all times. Use the bowl immediately after removing from the freezer. It will begin to quickly defrost once it has been removed for the freezer. Reminder: Your freezer should be set to 0\u00b0F to ensure proper freezing of all foods. Making Frozen Desserts or Drinks  Use Cuisinart recipes included in the Instruction Booklet or use your own recipe, making sure it yields 1-1/2 quarts or less.  Remove the freezer bowl from the freezer and place on the center of the base. The bowl will begin to defrost quickly once it has been removed from the freezer. Use it immediately after removing from freezer. Place mixing paddle in freezer bowl. It rests in the center of the bowl, with the circle side facing up. Place lid on the base and rotate clockwise until tabs on lid lock in place on base. Press On/Off switch to ON position. Freezer bowl will begin to turn. Immediately pour ingredients through ingredient spout. NOTE: Ingredients must be added to the freezer bowl after the unit is turned on. Frozen desserts or drinks will be done in less than 20 minutes. The time will depend on the recipe and volume of the dessert you are making. When the mixture has thickened to your liking, it is done. If you desire a firmer consistency, transfer the dessert to an airtight container and store in the freezer for two or more hours.  Adding Ingredients Ingredients such as chips and nuts should be added about 5 minutes before the recipe is complete. Once the dessert has began to thicken, add the ingredients through the ingredient spout. Nuts and other ingredients should be no larger than a chocolate chip.

In addition to the exclusive Cuisipro Surface Glide Technology, the entire line of Cuisipro graters and shavers possess well-applied ergonomics. Features Grate More With Less Effort With Surface Glide Technology:  The science behind Super Glide Technology is based in the repeated grooved pattern that is spread evenly across the face of the grating surface. The grooves provide 2 distinct benefits beyond other graters. First, the groove reduces resistance, making grating effortless. Secondly the groove elongates the length of each individual blade, so it has a larger cutting surface that comes in contact with food, therefore producing more gratings per stroke. Combined these features to create a perfect surface for outstanding uninterrupted grating performance where food glides through blades.  Protective Cover Doubles As A Measuring Tool:  The Rasps and Flat grater collection feature a snap on, clear protective cover with US and metric measurements. Not only does the cover provide safe storage, but is a container to catch grated ingredients for measuring. Very few graters offer protective covers and no other grater in the market provides a cover with the added benefit of measuring or catching the grated ingredient. Secure Grip For Safety:  The entire line of graters feature ergonomic handles with non-slip finish designed to protect your hands while providing the best grip possible for safe grating.

Pour water in the bottom container up to the MAX mark. Insert the funnel-shaped metal filter. Add fine ground coffee to the filter. Tighten the upper part (which has a second metal filter and a silicone gasket at the bottom) onto the water container. Place the espresso maker on a heat source making sure that the handle is not directly over heat.

Pour the coffee directly from the upper chamber and enjoy a perfect cup of espresso. What kind of ground coffee do I need?

When the handle is pulled up and released, the impact creates a score around the outside of the egg where the topper meets the shell. This allows you to remove the top of the shell with precision and avoids an unappealing jagged edge. The results are professional looking and easy to create.  Simple to Use After preparing a hard or soft boiled egg, cup the bottom of the egg in the palm of one hand. With your other hand, place the topper on the egg and hold in place with your hand that is holding the egg. Pull the spring-loaded handle straight up with your free hand and release it. You will hear a tap as the handle meets the surface of the egg. The impact will create a crack around the egg shell. Gently remove the topper from the egg. Typically, the top of the egg will have cracked enough to be removed easily. If the shell is at all difficult to remove, inset the very tip of a sharp knife into the crack and lift the shell upwards. Creating a Soft-Boiled Egg Fill a saucepan halfway with water and bring to a boil. Reduce to a fast simmer and carefully lower an egg into the water. Allow the egg to cook for 5-6 minutes, remove the egg from the water, then rinse under cold tap water for 45 seconds to stop the cooking process. Use the Paderno World Cuisine stainless steel egg topper to remove the top portion of the shell. Place the opened soft-boiled egg in an egg serving cup and serve with a small spoon and toast.

These \"cute-as-a-button\" personal mills add a touch of elegance to any meal service, whether for guests, for the hostess, or for the home dinner table. Crafted from highly refractive acrylic and topped with bright chrome accents, each mill measures 2 \u00bd-inches tall.   A difference you can taste Seasoning can dramatically enhance the flavor of a dish. Finish your culinary creation with a twist of freshly milled peppercorns or a dash of sea salt to fully enhance your flavor experience.  Optimum flavor delivery Rather than crushing peppercorns and releasing flavor quickly into the atmosphere, Cole & Mason's stainless steel pepper mechanism strips the peppercorns down layer by layer to ensure flavor and warmth is released slowly into food.  Superior milling performance Cole & Mason's Button mills are fitted with design-registered mechanisms that deliver optimum throughput - resulting in more grinds per turn.   Stainless steel mechanism for pepper Stainless steel is an ideal material for a pepper mill as it will not corrode and can be made very sharp, giving improved variability of grind. Nylon mechanism for salt The salt mechanism has a unique anti-static, clog-free design and is molded for high precision with sharp grinding teeth. Nylon is used due to its hard wearing characteristics. Being non-porous, nylon does not absorb odors and is therefore suitable for salt.   Easy to fill Unscrew the knob and remove cap to fill. Cole & Mason recommends high-grade, low moisture peppercorns and Maldon Sea Salt Crystals or Cole & Mason brand sea salt for use in our mills. Rock salt and sea salt flakes or French Sal de Mer are not suitable for our mills. Rock salt will wear down the mechanism, whereas high-moisture flakes will coagulate in the mill. Fully adjustable from fine to coarse Some dishes require finely milled pepper (think savory dishes or soups), while others demand coarse grinds to add a more intense flavor (steaks, fish or pasta). The spring-loaded Cole & Mason mechanisms ensure consistent grinds and are fully adjustable so you can easily change from fine to coarse to suit your dish. Simply adjust the grind by turning the knob clockwise for a fine grind and counter-clockwise for a coarse grind.   Lifetime mechanism guarantee Trusted for quality and durability, Cole & Mason mechanisms are long-lasting and are backed by a lifetime guarantee.  Use and care Keep salt and pepper mills away from moisture. Wipe with a warm cloth to clean.

The Breville Scraper Mixer Pro stand mixer helps make your baking stress-free.

Another LED display shows a timer that can be programmed to count up or count down, so you can set it to a recipe\u2019s specifications or time how long your favorite recipe takes, taking the guesswork out of the equation.

Another thoughtful design detail includes the fact that the containers can be nested together, and with the lid in place, they can be stacked one on top of the other--particularly useful where space is limited. *Unlock all four latches and loosen lid before use in microwave. Detailed Features Patented Blocking Hole System    Consistent flow of resin--does not produce a weld line along the hinge. Inconsistent flow of resin--produces a weld line over time.   Lock&Lock Classic lids feature four side flaps or \"wings\" that are hinged and slightly flared at the end for an easy grip when opening. More importantly, they come with holes (rectangular-shaped openings) that line up with matching knobs on the base of the containers, making it easy to latch the lid to the base, locking it into place. This patented blocking hole system maintains the integrity of the lid and helps promote an easy, tightly locked container.  Lid's 4 wings come with holes that line up with base Weld line does not form around the hinge piece Hinge is designed to be short in length to prevent stiffness when opening and closing    Blue hollow-center silicon band in the lid helps create an airtight, leak-proof seal. Special Silicone In addition to its blocking hole system, the Classic food-storage containers feature a blue hollow-center silicon ring in the lid that helps create an airtight, leak-proof seal. Generic silicon with a solid center doesn't compress as well and doesn't have the same restorative power as hollow-center silicon, which means an inferior seal. Lock&Lock's hollow-center silicon seal delivers superior compression and restoration power that helps ensure an airtight seal. Permeability When testing the freshness of foods, one of the most important factors is the permeability of the container. In comparison to other brands, the permeability of Lock&Lock products showed to be drastically better.   Strawberries stored at room temperature for 5 days. The freshness test is determined throughout the world by how much moisture permeates various containers. Test results show Lock&Lock airtight containers allow in 3,000 - 6,000 times less moisture than other containers, making them far more airtight.   Airtight seal means no messy spills or leaks to worry about. Excellent Airtight Seal Lock&Lock airtight containers passed the leakage test. Their four-sided locking system makes an airtight seal possible due to equal pressure on all four sides and the hollow-center silicone sealing ring.   Passed the KEMTI bending test. Durable Design Lock&Lock airtight containers have also passed the KEMTI bending test. The container and the wing were fixed to the bending test machine and bent 3,000,000 times 80 degrees left to right. If the container were to be used 10 times a day, it could be used for 821 years (semi-permanently).   Hygienic and food-safe. Healthy Living Lock&Lock Classic food-storage containers have passed the strict hygiene and safety tests of the U.S. FDA and German SGS. Made of high-quality BPA-free plastic, the durable and heat-resistance containers are food-safe and health-friendly.   Nest and stack for space-saving storage. Space-Saving Design When not in use, the cleverly designed food-storage containers nest together, both lids and bases, for compact storage in a drawer or on a shelf. The containers also offer a stacking system for maximum space efficiency. The flat lids make it easy to stack one container on top of another--a slight edge helps to keep stacked items in securely place, whether in the freezer, refrigerator, or cupboard. Whether just one or building a collection of several, Lock&Lock's Classic airtight containers offer a smart solution for food storage.

Heat sensors embedded in the grill plates compensate for the temperature drop when cold food is placed onto the pre-heated surface. The sensors then detect this heat drop and compensate by injecting heat for rapid recover back to the desired cooking temperatures. The 1800-watt embedded heating design ensures maximum heat into the plates for faster cooking and reduced pre-heating time. This creates a BBQ-quality sear and sizzle. The flat bottom plate is suitable for eggs and pancakes while the top plate is ribbed to sear meats. Plate positions are interchangeable and can be extended into an opened, flat 'BBQ Mode.'    The Breville BGR820XL Smart Grill uses Element IQ technology and an embedded element heating system to sear meat on your countertop that tastes just as good as meat seared on the barbecue (closeup on right).  Why the Breville Smart Grill? Every Breville product begins with a simple moment of brilliance. The Breville Smart Grill began with the simple fact that searing meat requires continuous high heat. What kind of machine cooks as well as a barbecue, but cleans fast like a frypan? The answer is the Breville Smart Grill, which allows you to sear meat indoors at a high consistent temperature without making a mess. It uses Element IQ technology and an 1800W heating system to electronically detect heat loss and provide rapid heat recovery. Maintaining High Heat for Better Cooking Countertop grills experience a drop in temperature when the cold meat or ingredients are introduced to the pre-heated surface. Even if they start off at the right temperature, most countertop grills can\u2019t recover from this heat loss, heating up again slowly. This means less efficient cooking and tougher meat. The BGR820XL uses a smart technology called Element IQ to detect the drop in temperature and inject more heat for a rapid recovery back to the desired cooking temperatures. Also, embedded elements in its grill plates help the grill maintain intense heat and recover from heat loss. The elements are cast into the plates themselves, which means that most of the heat generated by the elements is transferred to the plates instead of being lost (see below). That means less time to pre-heat and also rapid temperature recovery. Other Features: Easy cleaning and Versatility In addition to Element IQ and embedded plates, the Breville BGR820XL Smart Grill has numerous features: the top plate has six different adjustable heights that can be used for large sandwiches, small sliders, open-faced melts, or anything inbetween; the plates are removable for easier cleaning and can be interchanged depending on your needs (so the ribbed plate is either on the bottom or the top). The plates are nonstick plates made from cast aluminum coated with titanium infused Quantanium, for oil-free cooking and easy clean up. The housing is stainless steel, with die-cast arms. The base can be tilted at an angle to drain, or lay perfectly flat for eggs, pancakes, and paninis. You can use it closed and use it to grill like a Panini press, or open it 180 degrees into barbecue mode, in which fat is drained from both plates into the drip tray. There are three different temperature settings (low, Panini, and sear, ranging from 320F to 450F), temperature and time control dials, and a countdown timer and sound alert.   Exposed Heating Elements vs. the BGR820XL's Embedded Heating Elements   Exposed Heating Elements, typical of many grills    Embedded Heating Elements, like on the BGR820XL Smart Grill  Exposed Heating Elements: Heat loss Many plates have exposed heating elements, where the grill plate sits directly on top of the heating element. Exposed elements lose much of the heat that they generate, instead of transferring the heat to the plate. This means the grill requires more time to heat up and more time to recover from heat loss, which extends cooking time and yields tougher meats. Embedded Heating Elements: Heat transfer The BGR820XL has grill plates with integrated heating elements, where the elements are embedded in the plates themselves. Rather than losing much of the heat that they generate, the heat is transferred directly to the plate. This means the grill requires less time to heat up and less time to recover from heat loss, which decreases cooking time, increases searing temperatures, and yields tenderer meats.   Two modes for two different cooking styles   Panini Mode    Barbecue Mode  Panini Mode In Panini mode, use the top and bottom plates to press Paninis or grill ingredients on two sides at once. The height of the top plate from the bottom is adjustable, allowing you to press both large sandwiches and small sliders. There is a ribbed plate and a flat plate, and both plates are removable and interchangeable so you can choose the plate that suits your cooking style and clean the plates more easily. Barbecue Mode In barbecue mode, open the grill plates 180 degrees so the Smart Grill lies flat, and use it to grill and sear meats and vegetables. This doubles your cooking area, and also presents the option of grilling on both the flat plate and the ribbed plate. Additional ribbed plates and flat plates are available for purchase on Amazon if you'd prefer to have a uniform cooking surface in barbecue mode.   Temperature Control and Timing   The backlit LCD screen is blue when the grill is not hot    The backlit LCD screen is orange when the grill is pre-heating or cooking  Timer Control Dial (Located on the left side of the Smart Grill front) You can set the timer for your preferred cooking time, and the Smart Grill will alert you when time is up. Temperature Control Dial (Located on the right side of the Smart Grill front) You can set the Breville Smart Grill in three different temperature settings: low, Panini, and sear, which range from temperatures of 320F to 450F. If you'd prefer to view the temperature in Celsius, flip the temperature conversion button. Element IQ auto-adjustment Element IQ detects the drop in temperature when you introduce cold ingredients to the pre-heated surface and automatically injects more heat to bring the Smart Grill back up to temperature and compensate for heat-loss.

AM02 doesn\u2019t have blades. Instead, it uses Air Multiplier technology to amplify the air drawn in at its base by up to 14 times, generating an uninterrupted stream of smooth air. No blades. No buffeting. With no fast spinning blades, AM02 is safe to use around children. It\u2019s easy to clean too. And because it makes you feel cooler, you can turn down your air conditioning. AM02 is available in Silver/Silver or Iron/Blue. Patented Dyson Technology Dyson engineers are constantly testing and inventing, trying to find new ways to make their technology work better. As they work, they file patent applications to protect their inventions. That\u2019s why the only place you\u2019ll find Dyson technology is inside a Dyson machine. Dyson fans use Air Multiplier technology to amplify surrounding air. How The AM02 Works: Up to 9.51 gallons of air are drawn in per second by an energy efficient brushless motor. A combination of the technologies used in turbochargers and jet engines generates a powerful flow of air. Airflow is accelerated through an annular aperture. It passes over a 7-degree airfoil-shaped ramp, which channels its direction. Air behind the Dyson Air Multiplier fan is drawn into the airflow, through a process known as inducement. Air around the machine is also drawn into the airflow, through a process known as entrainment, amplifying it by up to 14 times. The resulting airflow is smooth and constant, with no unpleasant buffeting.  Features Smooth airflow:  The blades on conventional fans cause unpleasant buffeting because they chop the air. Air Multiplier technology creates an uninterrupted stream of smooth air.  Dimmer-switch control:  The airflow generated by the Dyson Air Multiplier fan can be adjusted at the turn of a dial to precisely deliver the amount of air that you want. No fast spinning blades:  Because there are no fast spinning blades, AM02 is safe to use around children. And with no blades or grilles it\u2019s easy to clean too.  Smooth Oscillation & a Remote Control: The AM02 fan oscillates 90 degrees at the touch of a button. Airflow and oscillation can be controlled using the remote control, which stores magnetically on top of the machine when not in use.  2-year parts and labor warranty:  All Dyson machines undergo a lengthy and rigorous testing program. That\u2019s why Dyson Air Multiplier fans include a 2-year warranty covering parts and labor.

To overcome this problem, he wrote down interesting words on pieces of paper and rearranged them, looking for inspiration. What he hadn't figured into this experiment was his allergies. One good sneeze and any progress was sent flying across the room. Dave decided to glue the words to pieces of magnets and stick them to a pizza tin. Then he got hungry and the now magnetized words made their way to the refrigerator door. Before too long, Dave wasn't the only one rearranging his would-be song lyrics. When friends came over, Dave noticed they started to move the magnets around, amusing themselves by writing the first magnetic poems.  After seeing his friends having fun, Dave thought he might be able to sell his word kits at a local craft fair. He made up 100 kits and set up shop at Calhoun Square, a mall in the Uptown area of Minneapolis. All 100 kits were gone after 3 hours. That night, he recruited as many friends as pizza and beer could draw and made up more kits--all of which sold as rapidly the next day.  From these beginnings, Magnetic Poetry\u00a8 has now sold over three million word kits, over one billion word tiles--growing from the Original Kit to a kid's line of kits, to foreign language kits, to Voice/theme kits.", "salesrank_2018": "721242"}, "B003TPY6EE": {"description": "Extra under-bed storage in an instant.

Our toppers have also earned the PURGreen certification, which means they are manufactured, fabricated and packaged in the U.S.A. meeting all EPA and CSPC standards being safe and free from harmful chemicals. PURGreen uses independent laboratory results to qualify products and ensure they are manufactured without the use of ozone-depleting substances such as Chlorofluorocarbons, Polybrominated Biphenyl Ether substances, Harmful Metals, Formaldehyde, Prohibited Phthalates or any other unsafe materials.

There may be a new foam smell associated with your new topper; however, this odor is not toxic or harmful passing all PURGreen, EPA and CSPC standards. MADE IN THE USA. Your memory foam mattress topper has been compressed and vacuum sealed for shipping purposes. Please carefully unpack the memory foam from the sealed packaging and lay completely flat allowing your topper to fully decompress for up to 96 hours at 72 degrees in cold weather. In warm weather the topper will expand rapidly; however, it will need time to \u201ccool\u201d down to an ambient room temperature of 72 degrees. Your memory foam topper is temperature sensitive and this is why it needs to reach an ambient temperature of approximately 72 degrees. U.S. made foam does not contain any toxic ingredients like formaldehyde or PBDE, polybrominateddiphenylether, but it can have new foam smell that lasts for a couple of days to a couple of weeks, based on the time of year the foam is produced. The foam smell does not necessarily trigger allergies; however, it can be bothersome to some people who have a sensitivity to smell. If the smell bothers you, try airing out the room and washing the sheets after a few nights of sleep on the new mattress.", "salesrank_2018": "325564"}, "B003U4MLNC": {"description": "-Here's a clever way to hide your valuables at home or even in a hotel. -You can safely keep valuables hidden inside your clothing in your closet with this US Patrol hanging garment closet safe. -This hanging clothing safe zips up to conceal the nine (9) clear pockets that can hold jewelry, credit cards, currency, or whatever you want to hide. -A deeper inner pocket holds your files and important documents and is perfect for use at home or while traveling. -This travel garment hideaway safe is made from cotton to look and feel like a real garment hanging with other items in your closet. -The durable zipper closure secures the hidden inner storage pockets. -Zippers keep stored your contents in their place and will allow for quick and easy access. -No one will know it's a safe except you!

Neato's laser-based Room Positioning System gives the robot vacuum a full 360-degree view of a room so it can create a map of the room, detecting walls, doorways, furniture and other obstacles. Using its map, the Neato XV-11 avoids most obstacles that other robots can only detect by impact. Just press the Start button and your Neato determines the best cleaning path to clean the floors using its unique, methodical straight-line pattern.   Once it finishes cleaning one entire room, the XV-11 drives through one of the \"recognized doorways,\" to start cleaning the next room. And, with its powerful vacuum suction, it picks up all your dirt, debris, and pet hair on your floors. Schedule it to clean every day with just a few button presses. Your home will always have that \"just cleaned\" look. It's Smart The Room Positioning System (RPS) is the proprietary technology that makes Neato as smart as--sometimes smarter--than a human housekeeper. It sees 360 degrees, maps out your room, and then methodically vacuums every square inch, carefully avoiding any furniture, obstacles and stairs. Go ahead and rearrange the furniture: Neato will adapt its course without missing a beat.  Additionally, if running low on power, the XV-11 returns to its charging base, recharges, and then returns to where it left off and finishes the cleaning job--making it a great choice for houses larger open floorplans.

Smart design and large dirt bin: The robot vacuum cleaner's low profile (less than four inches high) allows it to clean under beds, sofas, and toe-kicks in the kitchen. Self-docking to re-power: After completing its cleaning, it returns automatically to its base to re-charge itself.

Coffee is brewed by placing the coffee and water together, leaving to brew for a few minutes, then depressing the plunger to trap the coffee grinds at the bottom of the glass jug. A French press requires coffee of a more coarse grind than that used for a drip brew coffee filter, such as produced by a burr mill grinder rather than the whirling blade variety, as a finer grind will seep through the press filter and into the coffee. Because the coffee grounds remain in direct contact with the brewing water and the grinds are filtered from the water via a mesh instead of a paper filter, coffee brewed with the French press captures more of the coffee's flavor and essential oils, which would become trapped in a traditional drip brew machine's paper filters.

The newest generation of memory foam and gel technology, this mattress offers a plusher and incredibly comfortable sleeping surface. Beautifully tailored and detailed with a corded waterfall edge knit cover and contrasting border. Get a more restful night's sleep on this mattress knowing that it is made of the highest quality materials without worrying about the price. Plus, mattress includes a bonus shredded memory foam pillow with plush down-like feel with twin, twin extra long, and full or two bonus pillows with queen, king, or california king sizes.   The Classic Brands 14-inch profile Ultimate Cool Gel Memory Foam Mattress is designed for comfort and support. Starting with a 2-inch top layer, which consists of breathable ventilated Cool Gel memory foam that conforms to your shape and has a faster recovery factor than conventional memory foam. A second layer of 2-inch memory foam works with the 2-inch comfort foam support layer providing you with the ultimate sleeping experience. The 8-inch base layer maintains the strength and effectiveness of the layers. The layers work together to bring you the relaxation you crave and the ultimate sleeping experience, while lessening motion transfer.  Benefits of Gel Memory Foam A gel memory foam mattress can support each part of the body evenly and individually. Gel Memory foam slowly and automatically adjusts to your body weight and temperature. In addition to the slow, conforming response, gel memory foam offers complete, luxurious and stress-free support. Additionally, when you do move in bed, memory foam gently 'fills in' and reshapes itself to your new sleeping posture, cradling every contour of your body.   The Latest Gel Memory Foam Technology Gel Memory Foam is a unique material that infuses gel particles into visco-elastic memory foam, creating a plusher and cooler sleeping material. Gel memory foam is more porous or open than conventional foam meaning the cells are interconnected unlike closed cell foam; thereby is more breathable and comfortable than higher density visco-elastic foam. The open-celled physical structure of our foams is self-ventilating. Air travels throughout the material and dissipates body heat regulating your body temperature. Gel Memory foam is naturally hypoallergenic and resistant to allergens, mold, bacteria and dust mites.   Why Buy a Cool Gel Memory Foam Mattress?  Cool Gel mattresses with gel infused memory foam disperse body heat and create a cooler sleeping surface while retaining the pressure-relieving properties of traditional memory foam. Tossing and turning are dramatically diminished and disrupted sleep patterns are greatly eliminated so you can sleep longer without moving and enjoy the benefits of a deeper, more restful sleep pattern.   Adjustable Base Friendly Classic Brands 14-Inch Cool Gel Memory Foam Mattress is adjustable base friendly, which means it is the best choice to be paired up with an adjustable base instead of a traditional bed frame for added lifestyle and health benefits. The mattress is flexible and durable enough that it will maintain the support and integrity even after bending with the adjustable base.  CertiPUR-US Certified Classic Brands gel memory foam mattresses are CertiPUR-US Certified. The CertiPUR-US program is a voluntary testing, analysis and certification program for flexible polyurethane foam used as a cushioning material in home furnishings such as adult mattresses, crib mattresses, upholstered furniture and some accessory comfort products. Certified flexible polyurethane foams have been independently laboratory tested.    Get it Right the First Time It is also a good idea to know the size and the height of your mattress ahead of time to make sure you are ordering the correct size. Keep in mind that you should combine the height of your bed frame, foundation, or adjustable bed base with the height of your mattress to get a gauge of the how tall your sleep system will be.
