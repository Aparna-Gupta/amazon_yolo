Its Motor Technik design is unique and lets the motor remain at a constant speed whatever the load. Krups Motor Technik also means controlled rpm's, which means much less noise. This large, durable, stable 60-ounce blender has five speeds and ice-crushing and pulse functions to cover any situation that needs blending. Its touchpad control panel is illuminated, intuitive, and easy to see and use, and its graphite grey and brushed stainless steel coloring goes well on any kitchen counter. To get you started, the blender comes with a full-color recipe book with more than 50 recipes.     More \"Controlled Usable\" Power        The Krups Motor Technik is a unique electronic motor control system that provides constant power and speed whatever the load, ensuring consistent, professional results and allowing intensive heavy-duty use. Unloaded, most kitchen machines have high rotation speed. When a blender is loaded with ingredients, this rpm level drops dramatically, decreasing the rotation speed and affecting performance and results. Thanks to the Krups Motor Technik, the motor remains at a consistent speed whatever the load, ensuring perfect results and allowing intensive heavy-duty use. And its 1,000 watts make it one of the most powerful blenders on the market.           But this consistent speed doesn\u2019t mean you have to endure excessive noise. The KB720 stays very quiet, thanks to Motor Technik, which also controls the rpm's, creating less noise. Actually, most blenders are more than twice as loud as the KB720. There are many other features that make this blender stand out from the crowd, including an easily removable cap with 1- and 2-ounce measure marks, a bi-injected waterproof locking lid for clean preparation, and a high-quality, heavy-duty, thermal-shock-resistant glass jar made of borosilicate glass.

Detachable and washable inner lid. cETLus listed    Make every rice type imaginable with a Zojirushi Rice Cooker   Brown RiceThis is a menu setting designed to cook delicious brown rice. In order to cook hard rice bran and the rice inside, preheating time is extended for better absorption of water, and is cooked at a lower temperature to allow the rice to cook longer without becoming mushy.   Sushi RiceBecause sushi rice will be processed after it's cooked, it's easier to handle when it is a little firmer. This menu setting is very similar to regular white rice, but uses less water (adjusted by the water fill lines) for a firm finish.   MixedMixed rice is rice cooked with additional ingredients and seasonings. This setting extends preheating for better absorption of seasoning. Also, the cooking temperature is slightly lower than regular white rice, to avoid ingredients from boiling over.   PorridgeInstead of cooking rice in larger amounts of water and risk making it sloppy, use the porridge setting to cook fluffy porridge. Cooking temperature is slightly lower than regular white rice, to be cooked longer for soft texture.   MICOM (Microcomputer) Technology Aided by microcomputer technology, this category of rice cooker takes having rice on your menu from \u201coccasional\u201d to \u201cserious\u201d. Basically, the microchip does all the thinking for you, as far as adjusting cooking times and temperatures according to the type of rice you are cooking, and timing the pre-soaking of the raw grains and the final \u201cwait\u201d period during steaming.   MICOM allows the cooker to have multiple functions on its menu, making it a necessity for any avid rice fan who wants to incorporate rice into her daily diet. How it Works Conventional rice cookers simply turn on and off in reaction to temperature. The \u201cfuzzy logic\u201d of MICOM fine tunes this adjustment to adapt to various rice types, such as white, brown, sweet or porridge, which all has different cooking requirements. The trigger to everything is the thermal sensor, a small round button at the bottom of the inner body of the cooker. As the inner pan\u2019s weight rests on it and activates the sensor, it starts the cooking process and keeps an eye on the temperature and time.   Key Features:   Convenient detachable inner lid for easy cleaning.    Spherical inner cooking pan provides even heating for better cooker.

In most cases, they\u2019re the first thing you reach for when you need to quickly clean something up or wipe something down.

A design collaboration between Jason Nip and Paul Rowan, Tug features simple, elegant lines and a modern brushed nickel finish that is sure to enhance your kitchen decor.One-Handed Tear Every TimeNot only does Tug\u2019s patented design look great, it also flat out gets the job done. The secret is the unique shape of the 13.5-inch curved rubber spine. It\u2019s been engineered to provide just the right amount of resistance to hold the core of any standard size paper towel roll in place so you get an easy one-handed tear every time.Easy to Load and Easy to UseWith nothing to remove or unscrew and no tension arm to hold back, Tug Paper Towel Holder couldn\u2019t be easier to load. Simply slide your favorite brand of standard size paper towel roll onto the spine and you\u2019re ready to go \u2013 it\u2019s that simple.Using Tug to dispense paper towel when you need to clean something up or wipe something down is just as easy. Simply pull back a sheet of paper towel, then give a firm \u2018tug\u2019 from the top down to tear the sheet away along the paper towel perforation. It may take an attempt or two, but you\u2019ll have the technique mastered before you know it.Unlike traditional mounted paper towel dispensers that are fixed in place, Tug Stand Up Paper Towel Holder gives you the flexibility and convenience to move it around to where it\u2019s needed most (counter, table, island, patio, picnic table, etc.). The weighted base has a diameter of 6.5 inches which helps prevent it from toppling over and ensures it stays in place each time you tear off a sheet.

This will result in a double espresso. To make an Americano, simply top off the mug with hot water, or add hot milk for a creamy latte. The AeroPress can press from 1 to 4 scoops, and each scoop from the included AeroPress scoop makes the equivalent of a single espresso or 5 ounces of American coffee. Fill the chamber with hot water to the number corresponding to the number of scoops.  You can also make a full carafe of coffee using the AeroPress in less time than it takes to brew a pot of drip coffee. Two 3-scoop or 4-scoop pressing, topped off with hot water, will fill most vacuum carafes.  The AeroPress is the result of several years of applied research by inventor/engineer Alan Adler, who conducted numerous brewing experiments, measuring the brew with laboratory instruments. The experiments demonstrated that proper temperature, total immersion and rapid filtering were key to flavor excellence. He then designed and tested dozens of brewers before settling on the AeroPress design. Adler's best-known invention is the Aerobie flying ring which set the Guinness World record for the world's farthest throw (1,333 feet). Comparison of Brewing Methods Drip Brewing Traditional drip brewing passes water through a bed of grounds. When the water first drips into the bed, it is too hot and bitterness is extracted. As the water filters downward through the bed, it becomes too cool and extraction is weak. The water doesn't contact all of the grounds uniformly. Grounds at the edge of the bed are under-extracted, while grounds at the center are over- extracted and contribute bitterness.  Total immersion of the grounds in the AeroPress completely solves these problems. All of the grounds contact the same water temperature, and the brewing process is short and sweet. The gentle air pressure of the AeroPress also extracts extra flavor from the coffee. Ordinary drip brewers leave a lot of flavor in their soggy grounds.  The drip method cannot make a robust single cup because the small amount of water doesn't heat the bed enough for rich extraction. It is also slow. AeroPress makes one to four servings with a single pressing in less than a minute. The flavor is equally rich for any number of cups.  Espresso Machines Most coffee lovers agree that espresso is less bitter than drip brew because of the shorter brewing time. However when we ran comparison taste-tests in the homes of espresso lovers, they all agreed that AeroPress espresso tasted better than the brew from their high-priced European espresso machines--why? The reason is that the total immersion brewing of the AeroPress yields a robust flavor at lower temperature--and lower temperature brew is far less bitter. Home espresso machines don\u2019t allow adjustment of temperature. But even if they did, their lack of total immersion would not yield robust flavor at reduced temperature. In addition to smoother taste, the AeroPress has several other advantages over conventional espresso machines.  Grind is not critical in the AeroPress. Grind is so critical in espresso machines that most grinders cannot produce a grind fine enough to make a good tasting shot! Special espresso grinders cost hundreds of dollars and require frequent cleaning.  Espresso experts always adjust the grind when there are changes in humidity or batches of coffee. They throw away two or three shots while adjusting the grind in to achieve the desired 25-second shot.  There is no tamping in the AeroPress. Books on espresso teach the art of just the right amount of tamping. They instruct the home barista to practice on the bathroom scale to learn exactly thirty pounds of pressure.  There is no pre-warming of the portafilter head. In fact the AeroPress has no portafilter head!  There is no maintenance. Espresso machines require regular cleaning and descaling with caustic chemicals. They also require disassembly and cleaning of the showerhead.  There is no need to judge when to stop the pull. This is the most critical skill in using an espresso machine. As espresso lovers well know, most would-be baristas in coffee shops, hotels and restaurants run the pump too long--extracting sour bitterness from the grounds.  With the AeroPress, the amount of water is predetermined by the user, who can brew any strength from weak to super-intense just by choosing the desired amount of water prior to pressing.   Pod Brewers Many single-cup pod brewers have come to market recently. Some of these machines make American coffee. Others make espresso. They range in price from about $60 to several hundred dollars. A highly respected product review magazine tested the three most popular pod brewers and reported the flavor as \"mediocre at best.\"  French Presses People see some similarities between the AeroPress and a French Press. Both use total immersion and pressure. But the similarities end there.  The filter in the French Press is at the top of the mixture. Because coffee floats, the floating grounds clog the filter and makes pressing and cleaning very difficult. Users are instructed to use only coarse ground coffee. But this reduces the amount of flavor that can be extracted from the coffee and necessitates long steeping times which extract bitterness.  Furthermore, even coarse ground coffee includes many fine particles. These small particles pass through and around the filter resulting in a bitter, gritty brew. The particles in the brew continue to leach out bitterness. Consequently French press users are advised to drink or decant the brew immediately. Also, some particles clog the filter screen making pressing and cleaning very difficult.  AeroPress coffee is micro-filtered. It so pure and particle-free that it can be stored for days as a concentrate. The concentrate can be drunk as espresso, mixed with milk for lattes, or diluted to make American coffee. French presses cannot make espresso or lattes. Finally, cleaning the French press is quite a chore. The AeroPress chamber is self-cleaning. A ten-second rinse of the plunger is all that's required.", "salesrank_2018": "1157"}, "B000GXZLLO": {"description": "Attractively housed in durable stainless steel, this ultra-convenient toaster oven features convection technology for faster, more thorough cooking.

Adams make it easy to save on valuable kitchen space while enjoying the best of USA-made craftsmanship. The family-owned company provides everything from pot hooks and spice bottles to wooden spice carousels, kitchen-knife blocks, bread boxes, wine racks, pot racks, and more. J.K. Adams' wooden kitchen items feature renewable and sustainable wood in Maple, Cherry, Walnut, Alder, Ash, or Hickory varieties. A thoughtful choice for gift giving, the high-quality kitchen items provide sleek designs and convenient functionality for year after year of everyday convenience. Innovative Kitchen-Storage Solutions In the late-1970's, when the gourmet-chef-tools market in the U.S. was still in its infancy, J.K. Adams owner Malcolm Cooper, Sr. conceived of the first slanted knife block. His goal was to create a cutlery organizer that would hold knives at a low enough angle that they could be easily removed from the block when it was pushed back under a cabinet overhang. The J.K. Adams Kangaroo knife block was launched in 1980--the first-ever slanted knife block, and still the best. Recognizing the many opportunities to improve kitchen storage, J.K. Adams introduced the revolving \"carousel\" spice rack in 1982 followed by countless other well-designed storage products in the years since, including the popular in-drawer knife tray in 1994, a space-saving alternative to the knife block that offers the same safety and blade protection. In 2011, J.K. Adams takes cutlery storage to a new level once again with the new Universal knife block. For over 30 years, J.K. Adams has continued to lead and inspire the kitchen storage market with their innovative designs, superior hardwoods, and exemplary craftsmanship.  Today, J.K. Adams continues to provide innovative designs, superior hardwoods, and high-quality craftsmanship. J.K. Adams: Over 65 Years of New England Yankee Craftsmanship          Some of the world's finest woodworkers can be found in New England. The rich heritage and folklore of the great Yankee Woodworker is as well known today as it was hundreds of years ago, and the craft has been handed down through the generations. J.K. Adams' success is certainly attributable to the early Vermonters employed by the company while in its infancy who brought forth the techniques and quality craftsmanship that could only come from generations of shared knowledge and experience. The J.K. Adams factory has been at the same location since the beginning. As many as three generations of families have relied on J.K. Adams to provide for their families. Located in a rural area of Vermont, J.K. Adams remains one of the largest employers in the area and is an important pillar of support for the local community. J.K. Adams has always used the creativity and skill of their workforce in developing new products, and today J.K. Adams continues its New England craftsmanship with a wide variety of cutting boards, as well as wooden salad bowls, kitchen islands, and slate serving trays. And at the J.K. Adams factory, you'll find future generations of woodworkers building upon the traditions begun over 65 years ago. Cutting boards and other products by J.K Adams are made in the North America.     About J.K. Adams' Logo In colonial New England, three strokes of a broad ax were used to mark the finest trees in the forest for the Queens' Navy shipmasts. The broad arrow was adopted as our logo because it symbolizes the exceptional quality of wood that goes into our products. J.K. Adams' Company History  Started over 65 years ago in a small garage in Dorset, Vermont Cooper family purchased business from founder Josiah K. Adams in 1949 Began with the Speedy Racer toy, and then followed by manufacturing drafting and surveying tables, Kiwi shoe groomers, gifts, and furniture Now the leading supplier of wooden storage and food preparation products for the specialty housewares industry   Our Wood  Maple, Cherry, Walnut, Alder, Ash, and Hickory Either from New England or other North American sources Renewable and sustainable Hard and durable, yet forgiving to knife edges  Wood Grains End Grain  Prized for look and longest wear Identifiable by small pieces put together Board usually thick and heavy Many pieces, lots of glue joints, cracking can be a problem  Edge Grain  Most common in cutting boards Moderate grain pattern Stable with minimum glue joints  Why Choose a Wood Cutting Board? Wood is naturally anti-bacterial, and any bacteria left on the board will actually lessen in time versus multiplying on a plastic cutting board. A wooden board will also be more gentle on your knife's edge, and it just feels and sounds better under a knife. Caring for Your J.K. Adams Cutting Board Wash by hand in warm soapy water and dry thoroughly, and oil frequently with mineral oil to help give it an optimal appearance. Do not soak, microwave, freeze, or put in the dishwasher. For removing stains, you can use a weak bleach-and-water solution or a combination of lemon juice and salt. Be sure to rinse and wipe with mineral oil afterward. Additionally, the surface can be sanded to make the board look like new--although a board with wear will add character to your kitchen. For storage, keep the board away from strong sunlight as avoiding UV rays will reduce the risk of fading.   Environmental Responsibilities  We only purchase lumber from a select few suppliers who we are confident practice sustainable forestry practices Vermont forests are growing faster than they are being harvested J.K.

A quality mill with a specifically designed grinding mechanism will release the aromas and essential oils of that spice. Freshly ground pepper and spices have more aroma and better flavor than pre- ground. Another advantage of using freshly ground spices or minerals (salts) is the control a mill provides for determining the coarseness (size) of a grind. A high quality pepper, salt or spice mill gives you the ability to choose and change the coarseness according to taste or necessity.  How to Choose a Good Mill When looking for a pepper, salt or spice grinder, consider the following: Grinding mechanism: Choose a grinding mechanism that can withstand daily use: one that is well made and produces a consistent grind. Ideally, the grinding mechanism should be designed to handle a specific spice, as each spice has different physical characteristics that will benefit from different design features.  Design and appearance: Whether it's traditional or modern, manual or electric, a mill can be an indispensable tool in your kitchen and a beautiful part of table d\ufffdcor.  Ease of Use: A quality mill should be easy to adjust, easy to fill, and feel comfortable in the hand.  History of Peugeot Peugeot's story starts in the 19th century when the Peugeot brothers converted the family's gristmill into a steel foundry. They began producing award winning hand tools immediately after opening and went on to produce a diverse range of exceptional quality products including small appliances, bicycles and most notably, automobiles. (Although now operating as a separate company, the Peugeot car company continues the same commitment to quality and innovation that is a Peugeot hallmark). In 1840 Peugeot created their burr style coffee grinder and adopted that design to accommodate peppercorns in 1874. The resulting pepper mechanism design is still used today in every Peugeot pepper mill. Peugeot's iconic pepper grinding mechanism design is often copied, but never equaled. Today, Peugeot offers six unique spice-specific mechanisms plus the original burr-style coffee grinder. There are no shortcuts: each mechanism is designed to get the most out of the spices they are intended for. After more than 160 years, Peugeot mills and grinders remain the benchmark of the industry and have earned their position as the mill of choice in world class kitchens. It's All About the Mechanism  The primary difference between Peugeot and all other brands are the spice-specific mechanisms. Peugeot has 7 unique spice specific mechanisms for pepper, salt, herbs and spices, coffee, wet salt, chili peppers and nutmeg. For each spice, there is one - and only one - Peugeot grinding mechanism, each made of the ideal design and constructed from the best material available for its intended use. All Peugeot mechanisms are made in France and carry a lifetime limited warranty.    Peugeot's Pepper Grinding Mechanism is a two stage burr-style system. During production, the helix-shaped grooves and grinding teeth of the pepper mechanism are individually cut before the steel is case hardened to make it virtually indestructible. The mechanism is then given a proprietary treatment to provide additional protection against corrosion. During use, the helix- shaped grooves guide whole peppercorns through the mechanism to crack, then grind to a consistent size by a double row of teeth. This process releases the pepper's essential oils, resulting in more flavor and aroma for your dish. This patented mechanism is found on every Peugeot Pepper mill and is widely considered the best pepper mechanism available      Peugeot's Salt Crushing Mechanism features two ribbed plates which work to fracture and crush coarse, dry sea salt to a consistent size. The salt grinding mechanism is made of corrosion resistant Stainless Steel, and is found on every Peugeot Salt Mill.       A Peugeot Innovation u'Select is Peugeot's patented grind control system for electric and manual grinders. Beyond personal preferences, different stages of the preparation / cooking process and different dishes often call for seasonings of varying sizes. Peugeot now offers the ability to quickly, easily and accurately adjust the grind settings with its patented u'Select system.   From coarsely ground pepper or salt to very fine, u'Select offers: -6 pre-defined levels of grind for pepper, or any point in between. -6 pre-defined levels of grind for salt, or any point in between. Simplicity: just turn the ring at the base of the mill and select your grind size. The further you turn the ring, the finer or coarser the grind, depending on the direction turned. Precision: no risk that the grind will change during use.  The right grind: You are assured that with each setting, the grind will be consistent, time after time.     Fine or coarse grind-is it just a question of taste? Actually it depends on personal taste and the dish being prepared. While personal taste plays a role, some dishes call for coarse salt or pepper, whereas others require either or both to be finely ground. A finer grind will be used for a delicate sauce or mixed raw vegetables and a coarse grind for grilling a steak or when making heartier meats and dishes.    Anatomy of u'Select Mills These mills feature the innovative u'Select system. u'Select mills have the same renowned grinding mechanisms, beauty and functionality as classic Peugeot mills with an additional feature of easy grind selection. When you want to adjust the grind of your salt/pepper to more coarse or fine, you simply turn the u'Select ring at the base of the mill. You can select one of six pre-marked positions, or any point in between, for infinite possibilities. Your selection will not move or change until you want it to.    Manual MillsFor best grinding results: hold the mill body steady and turn mill top in a clockwise direction only    Electric Mills Press the Power switch to grind pepper or salt. Light will illuminate underneath mill when power switch is pressed. u'Select Ring:The narrower the wedge, the finer the grind.   Which pepper and which salt can be used in Peugeot Mills? Pepper:  To get the best results, we recommend you to use only dry, hard, whole peppercorns that are 5 mm (1/4\") or less in diameter. Black, white and dry green peppercorns can be ground in Peugeot pepper mills. Pink peppercorns can be ground only if in a blend (max 15% pink) with one of these other peppercorns. Dried coriander seeds are also suitable for the pepper mechanism.  Salt:  To get the best out of your Peugeot salt grinding mechanism, you should use: dry salt, ideally with a diameter of 4 mm (0.16\") such as coarse sea salt or rock salt (salt mined from an underground salt seam). Do not use your Peugeot salt mill for grinding pepper or any other spice, or damp sea salt (also known as grey salt, Guerande, Re, etc.) The moisture content is so high in damp salt that it will corrode the mill. Use a Peugeot Wet Salt mill with a mechanism specifically designed for damp salt. Its shape and materials have been designed to resist salt corrosion.

This heater is especially efficient, heating 99 percent of the air intake to give you 5,200 Btu or instant heat at just 1,500 watts. In addition, the automatic thermostat cuts off the heat at the desired temperature. It's safe, too: it includes a tip-over switch that cuts power when the unit is upended. The PTC heating element works at 200 degrees F, so it's not hot enough to ignite paper, carpet, or other flammable materials.--Josh DettweilerWhat's in the BoxHeater, power cord, instruction manualFive Tips for Buying a HeaterChoosing a space heater is a matter of sifting through a bewildering array of types, power ratings, and fuel sources. Let's break it down a little to make the process easier.What are the different types of space heaters?Radiant heaters emit infrared radiation that directly warms the objects in front of the heaters (rather than the surrounding air). If you only need heat by a desk or in a small section of a room, a radiant heater is quiet and will use very little power.Forced-air heaters use a fan to blow air that has been warmed by metal or ceramic heating elements. A forced-air heater is appropriate for quickly heating up a small- to medium-sized room, but can be noisy.Convection heaters draw cold air from the floor; the air is warmed by heating coils and emitted from the top of the heater. A convection heater is appropriate for quickly heating up a small- to medium-sized room, but also can be noisy.Radiators work by heating oil enclosed in a reservoir, gradually heating the surrounding air. If heating speed isn't an issue, you might want to opt for a radiator. These are extremely quiet and effective--perfect for bedrooms. Should I buy an electric or a combustion model?If you want a heater that will be available in emergencies, or that can heat areas larger than a single room, choose a \"combustion\" model--one that is powered by a gas or fuel like propane, kerosene, natural gas, or diesel. Which fuel type you choose depends largely on convenience and local availability. For example, diesel would be appropriate for a heater you take with you on long car trips. How powerful a heater do I need?Heaters are rated by BTU, which stands for British Thermal Unit (the amount of heat needed to heat one pound of water by 1 degree F). To find out how many BTU you need: Calculate the volume of the space to be heated by multiplying square footage by height. Multiply that number by 4 if your insulation is poor, 3 if it's average, or 2 if it's good.The resulting number is a ballpark figure for how many BTU you'll need.Do space heaters cost a lot to operate? As a general rule, electric space heaters are more expensive to use than combustion models. To ensure energy efficiency, a thermostat is a must-have feature for any heater. For radiant heaters, models with a 360 degree heating surface can heat larger spaces. If you need a forced-air heater, models with ceramic elements tend to be more efficient.Are space heaters a fire hazard?Space heaters are implicated in about 25,000 residential fires every year. To ensure proper safety, always follow the manufacturer's usage instructions and fill out the warranty card to receive informational updates from the manufacturer. Also, look for extra safety features such as an automatic shutoff switch that can shut down the unit if, for example, it gets upended. In addition, choose a model where the heating element is adequately enclosed within the unit.", "salesrank_2018": "2494904"}, "B000HUKYTK": {"description": "Finally, no more struggling to scoop your ice cream.

The Multi-Tech has multiple technologies for pollutants such as cigarette smoke and other odors, including the activated carbon filter, ionizer and programmable sanitizer. The Multi-tech seeks and destroys pollutants across the room with its negative ion air purification system. The U.S. Dept. of Agriculture found negative ion air purification (ionizers) to be 99% effective at removing airborne dust and particles. Under normal circumstances, Multi-Tech replacement costs will run just $25 to $50 per year (for replacement filters and UV lamp each year). Use of the Multi-Tech will only add a few dollars or so per month to your power bill. Its powerful fan increases air-cleaning efficiency by effectively moving the air. Even with the fan setting on high, the Multi-Tech is very quiet.

This hard rock maple, mezzaluna cutting board measures 10 by 10 inches (WxL) and is 2 inches thick. The US made board features edge grain construction with a rounded mezzaluna bowl inside--ideal for mincing fresh herbs and other seasonings.    John Boos & Company circa 1900. The History of John Boos & Co In business since 1887, John Boos & Co. is the oldest industry in South Central Illinois. Founder, Conrad Boos Sr. named the business after his son, John and for years, worked out of a blacksmith shop in Effingham. The blacksmith used a Sycamore tree placed on three legs to straighten horseshoes. The wooden block absorbed the shock of the hammer. In 1890, a local butcher realized the block could be used for cutting meat, and had one made. The word spread to surrounding small towns and cities and by 1911, John Boos was shipping from coast to coast.   In 1956, John Boos began to sell some of their products for home use. Today, John Boos cutting boards are found in hotels and restaurant kitchens, culinary schools, and on televised cooking shows. The old craftsmen work ethic is still around at John Boos, with a few changes.Premium Hard Rock Maple lumber from the surrounding Mid-West and Northern States is used in place of Sycamore lumber. And John Boos automation has replaced much of the older equipment with the exception of the 1942 block press which is very much in use today. John Boos & Co. utilizes 100% of their raw material to benefit the manufacturing processes. The smallest lumber scraps are transformed into sawdust and used to generate electricity and create steam to fuel the boilers.   The Early Years In 1892 the Boos family sold interest in the company to the Gravenhorst family. In 1895 the building burned and was rebuilt. In 1899 they moved to the present site of 315 South First Street for more space.  In 1920, they added extra buildings and kilns.. By the 1940s, butcher blocks were found in every restaurant, food store and butcher shop in America. Last Half of the Century Following WWII, the company added a dry kiln, increased its office space, and added manufacturing space. The shipping docks were enlarged while warehousing space and new products were added.    The company continued expanding through the 60s and '70s with the growth of its metal table market with synthetic tops, stainless-steel tops, or maple tops. Even though the government was tough on wood products through the 1970s and '80s, the company continued to grow with its new line of BDL store fixtures, park benches, and other butcher block furniture. Current Products & Markets The wood and metal products are listed with the National Sanitation Foundation, the leader in sanitation agencies for approving equipment to be installed in foodservice and supermarket operations. The products must have approval of various sanitation agencies in order to be accepted by the industry. John Boos & Co. Cucina butcher blocks and cutting boards are used by celebrity chefs throughout the USA, including Charlie Trotter, Ming Tsai, Paul Kahan, Susan Spicer, Mary Sue Milliken, and Susan Feninger. In addition, chef\u2019s featured on \"The Food Network\", such as Mario Batali and Emeril Lagasse, prepare meals every day on John Boos cutting boards. In 1994, we were we were 1 of 22 companies awarded the Gold Medal for Excellence in Foodservice Equipment by the Chefs of America at a ceremony conducted at Carnegie Hall in NYC. John Boos & Company Today The company currently occupies approximately 150,000 square feet in Effingham, IL and approximately 65,000 square feet in Philipsburg, PA and Suring, WI. The company\u2019s four dry kilns dry up to 210,000 board feet of lumber on a continual basis. Most of the hardwoods used for manufacturing are shipped from the Great Lakes, while the stainless steel comes from warehouses and distribution centers in Chicago, Indianapolis, and St. Louis.  Care and Maintenance Keeping Your Board Sanitized Wash your John Boos cutting board with hot soapy water after each use and dry it with a clean towel or let it air dry. For further sanitation, the board can be rinsed with a vinegar or chlorine bleach solution. (1 teaspoon bleach to one quart of water/5-to-1 ratio of vinegar to water) Do not soak the board in water--this will damage the wood. Wood cutting boards are NOT dishwasher-safe. Maintaining Your Board Oil your cutting board on all surfaces every 3-4 weeks. The Boos block cream finish with beeswax (included with the board) will protect and prolong the board\u2019s life. We recommend using John Boos Mystery Oil and/or Boos Block Cream with Beeswax. Research: Plastic vs. Wooden Cutting Boards Led by Dean O. Cliver, Ph.D, a research team compared plastic and wooden cutting boards to find out how to best disinfect wooden cutting boards from bacteria. They found that disease bacteria were not recoverable from both new and older knife-scarred wooden surfaces in a short time after they were applied, unless very large numbers were used. They found that while new plastic surfaces allowed the bacteria to persist, they were easily cleaned and disinfected. However, they found that older, knife-scarred plastic surfaces were impossible to clean and disinfect manually, especially when food residues such as chicken fat were present. Further, they found that if a sharp knife is used to cut into the work surfaces after used plastic or wood has been contaminated with bacteria and cleaned manually, more bacteria are recovered from the plastic surface than from the wood surface. The research team has no commercial relationships to John Boos or any other company making cutting boards. They believe, on the basis of their published and to-be-published research that food can be prepared safely on wooden cutting surfaces and that plastic cutting surfaces present some disadvantages. In conclusion, they believe their research shows evidence that wooden cutting boards are not a hazard to human health, but plastic cutting boards may be.

This oil meets U.S. Pharmacopeia (USP) standards for mineral oil purity and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations for use near food (FDA 21 CFR 178.3620).  Sharpening stones, or whetstones, are abrasive surfaces used to sharpen and hone the edges of steel cutting implements, such as chisels, knives, scissors, hand scrapers, and plane blades. Sharpening is the process of creating or re-establishing a cutting edge by grinding away portions of the metal to adjust the angle of the edge and reform the shape. Honing removes small imperfections. Stones can be flat, for working flat edges, or shaped, for edges that are more complex. When used with lubricating liquid, a sharpening stone can be called a waterstone or an oilstone, based on the lubricant required. Oilstones use sharpening stone oil for lubrication when sharpening, to prevent metal from bonding with the abrasive surface by flushing away dislodged abrasive and metal chips. Norton Abrasives manufactures sanding, grinding, and polishing abrasives, and has been located in the United States since 1885.

The cookie dough or batter is put into a pizzelle iron. The iron stamps a snowflake pattern onto both sides of the thin golden-brown cookie, which has a crisp texture once it is cooled. Pizzelle shaped into a cannolo and filled with an orange-almond creme. Pizzelle are popular during Christmas and Easter. They are often found at Italian weddings, alongside other traditional pastries such as cannoli and traditional Italian cookies. It is also common for two pizzelle to be sandwiched with cannoli cream (ricotta blended with sugar) or hazelnut spread. Pizzelle, while still warm, can also be rolled using a wooden dowel to create cannoli shells.", "salesrank_2018": "18489"}, "B000I1U3AI": {"description": "Parchment paper cooking is a time tested method used by chefs around the world.

Adams: A 2nd-Generation, Family-Owned Company Kitchen storage solutions by J.K. Adams make it easy to save on valuable kitchen space while enjoying the best of USA-made craftsmanship. The family-owned company provides everything from pot hooks and spice bottles to wooden spice carousels, kitchen-knife blocks, bread boxes, wine racks, pot racks, and more. J.K. Adams' wooden kitchen items feature renewable and sustainable wood in Maple, Cherry, Walnut, Alder, Ash, or Hickory varieties. A thoughtful choice for gift giving, the high-quality kitchen items provide sleek designs and convenient functionality for year after year of everyday convenience. Innovative Kitchen-Storage Solutions In the late-1970's, when the gourmet-chef-tools market in the U.S. was still in its infancy, J.K. Adams owner Malcolm Cooper, Sr. conceived of the first slanted knife block. His goal was to create a cutlery organizer that would hold knives at a low enough angle that they could be easily removed from the block when it was pushed back under a cabinet overhang. The J.K. Adams Kangaroo knife block was launched in 1980--the first-ever slanted knife block, and still the best. Recognizing the many opportunities to improve kitchen storage, J.K. Adams introduced the revolving \"carousel\" spice rack in 1982 followed by countless other well-designed storage products in the years since, including the popular in-drawer knife tray in 1994, a space-saving alternative to the knife block that offers the same safety and blade protection. In 2011, J.K. Adams takes cutlery storage to a new level once again with the new Universal knife block. For over 30 years, J.K. Adams has continued to lead and inspire the kitchen storage market with their innovative designs, superior hardwoods, and exemplary craftsmanship.  Today, J.K. Adams continues to provide innovative designs, superior hardwoods, and high-quality craftsmanship. J.K. Adams: Over 65 Years of New England Yankee Craftsmanship          Some of the world's finest woodworkers can be found in New England. The rich heritage and folklore of the great Yankee Woodworker is as well known today as it was hundreds of years ago, and the craft has been handed down through the generations. J.K. Adams' success is certainly attributable to the early Vermonters employed by the company while in its infancy who brought forth the techniques and quality craftsmanship that could only come from generations of shared knowledge and experience. The J.K. Adams factory has been at the same location since the beginning. As many as three generations of families have relied on J.K. Adams to provide for their families. Located in a rural area of Vermont, J.K. Adams remains one of the largest employers in the area and is an important pillar of support for the local community. J.K. Adams has always used the creativity and skill of their workforce in developing new products, and today J.K. Adams continues its New England craftsmanship with a wide variety of cutting boards, as well as wooden salad bowls, kitchen islands, and slate serving trays. And at the J.K. Adams factory, you'll find future generations of woodworkers building upon the traditions begun over 65 years ago. Cutting boards and other products by J.K Adams are made in the North America.     About J.K. Adams' Logo In colonial New England, three strokes of a broad ax were used to mark the finest trees in the forest for the Queens' Navy shipmasts. The broad arrow was adopted as our logo because it symbolizes the exceptional quality of wood that goes into our products. J.K. Adams' Company History  Started over 65 years ago in a small garage in Dorset, Vermont Cooper family purchased business from founder Josiah K. Adams in 1949 Began with the Speedy Racer toy, and then followed by manufacturing drafting and surveying tables, Kiwi shoe groomers, gifts, and furniture Now the leading supplier of wooden storage and food preparation products for the specialty housewares industry   Our Wood  Maple, Cherry, Walnut, Alder, Ash, and Hickory Either from New England or other North American sources Renewable and sustainable Hard and durable, yet forgiving to knife edges  Wood Grains End Grain  Prized for look and longest wear Identifiable by small pieces put together Board usually thick and heavy Many pieces, lots of glue joints, cracking can be a problem  Edge Grain  Most common in cutting boards Moderate grain pattern Stable with minimum glue joints  Why Choose a Wood Cutting Board? Wood is naturally anti-bacterial, and any bacteria left on the board will actually lessen in time versus multiplying on a plastic cutting board. A wooden board will also be more gentle on your knife's edge, and it just feels and sounds better under a knife. Caring for Your J.K. Adams Cutting Board Wash by hand in warm soapy water and dry thoroughly, and oil frequently with mineral oil to help give it an optimal appearance. Do not soak, microwave, freeze, or put in the dishwasher. For removing stains, you can use a weak bleach-and-water solution or a combination of lemon juice and salt. Be sure to rinse and wipe with mineral oil afterward. Additionally, the surface can be sanded to make the board look like new--although a board with wear will add character to your kitchen. For storage, keep the board away from strong sunlight as avoiding UV rays will reduce the risk of fading.   Environmental Responsibilities  We only purchase lumber from a select few suppliers who we are confident practice sustainable forestry practices Vermont forests are growing faster than they are being harvested J.K.

Adams make it easy to save on valuable kitchen space while enjoying the best of USA-made craftsmanship. The family-owned company provides everything from pot hooks and spice bottles to wooden spice carousels, kitchen-knife blocks, bread boxes, wine racks, pot racks, and more. J.K. Adams' wooden kitchen items feature renewable and sustainable wood in Maple, Cherry, Walnut, Alder, Ash, or Hickory varieties. A thoughtful choice for gift giving, the high-quality kitchen items provide sleek designs and convenient functionality for year after year of everyday convenience. Innovative Kitchen-Storage Solutions In the late-1970's, when the gourmet-chef-tools market in the U.S. was still in its infancy, J.K. Adams owner Malcolm Cooper, Sr. conceived of the first slanted knife block. His goal was to create a cutlery organizer that would hold knives at a low enough angle that they could be easily removed from the block when it was pushed back under a cabinet overhang. The J.K. Adams Kangaroo knife block was launched in 1980--the first-ever slanted knife block, and still the best. Recognizing the many opportunities to improve kitchen storage, J.K. Adams introduced the revolving \"carousel\" spice rack in 1982 followed by countless other well-designed storage products in the years since, including the popular in-drawer knife tray in 1994, a space-saving alternative to the knife block that offers the same safety and blade protection. In 2011, J.K. Adams takes cutlery storage to a new level once again with the new Universal knife block. For over 30 years, J.K. Adams has continued to lead and inspire the kitchen storage market with their innovative designs, superior hardwoods, and exemplary craftsmanship.  Today, J.K. Adams continues to provide innovative designs, superior hardwoods, and high-quality craftsmanship. J.K. Adams: Over 65 Years of New England Yankee Craftsmanship          Some of the world's finest woodworkers can be found in New England. The rich heritage and folklore of the great Yankee Woodworker is as well known today as it was hundreds of years ago, and the craft has been handed down through the generations. J.K. Adams' success is certainly attributable to the early Vermonters employed by the company while in its infancy who brought forth the techniques and quality craftsmanship that could only come from generations of shared knowledge and experience. The J.K. Adams factory has been at the same location since the beginning. As many as three generations of families have relied on J.K. Adams to provide for their families. Located in a rural area of Vermont, J.K. Adams remains one of the largest employers in the area and is an important pillar of support for the local community. J.K. Adams has always used the creativity and skill of their workforce in developing new products, and today J.K. Adams continues its New England craftsmanship with a wide variety of cutting boards, as well as wooden salad bowls, kitchen islands, and slate serving trays. And at the J.K. Adams factory, you'll find future generations of woodworkers building upon the traditions begun over 65 years ago. Cutting boards and other products by J.K Adams are made in the North America.     About J.K. Adams' Logo In colonial New England, three strokes of a broad ax were used to mark the finest trees in the forest for the Queens' Navy shipmasts. The broad arrow was adopted as our logo because it symbolizes the exceptional quality of wood that goes into our products. J.K. Adams' Company History  Started over 65 years ago in a small garage in Dorset, Vermont Cooper family purchased business from founder Josiah K. Adams in 1949 Began with the Speedy Racer toy, and then followed by manufacturing drafting and surveying tables, Kiwi shoe groomers, gifts, and furniture Now the leading supplier of wooden storage and food preparation products for the specialty housewares industry   Our Wood  Maple, Cherry, Walnut, Alder, Ash, and Hickory Either from New England or other North American sources Renewable and sustainable Hard and durable, yet forgiving to knife edges  Wood Grains End Grain  Prized for look and longest wear Identifiable by small pieces put together Board usually thick and heavy Many pieces, lots of glue joints, cracking can be a problem  Edge Grain  Most common in cutting boards Moderate grain pattern Stable with minimum glue joints  Why Choose a Wood Cutting Board? Wood is naturally anti-bacterial, and any bacteria left on the board will actually lessen in time versus multiplying on a plastic cutting board. A wooden board will also be more gentle on your knife's edge, and it just feels and sounds better under a knife. Caring for Your J.K. Adams Cutting Board Wash by hand in warm soapy water and dry thoroughly, and oil frequently with mineral oil to help give it an optimal appearance. Do not soak, microwave, freeze, or put in the dishwasher. For removing stains, you can use a weak bleach-and-water solution or a combination of lemon juice and salt. Be sure to rinse and wipe with mineral oil afterward. Additionally, the surface can be sanded to make the board look like new--although a board with wear will add character to your kitchen. For storage, keep the board away from strong sunlight as avoiding UV rays will reduce the risk of fading.   Environmental Responsibilities  We only purchase lumber from a select few suppliers who we are confident practice sustainable forestry practices Vermont forests are growing faster than they are being harvested J.K.

Adams: A 2nd-Generation, Family-Owned Company Kitchen storage solutions by J.K. Adams make it easy to save on valuable kitchen space while enjoying the best of USA-made craftsmanship. The family-owned company provides everything from pot hooks and spice bottles to wooden spice carousels, kitchen-knife blocks, bread boxes, wine racks, pot racks, and more. J.K. Adams' wooden kitchen items feature renewable and sustainable wood in Maple, Cherry, Walnut, Alder, Ash, or Hickory varieties. A thoughtful choice for gift giving, the high-quality kitchen items provide sleek designs and convenient functionality for year after year of everyday convenience. Innovative Kitchen-Storage Solutions In the late-1970's, when the gourmet-chef-tools market in the U.S. was still in its infancy, J.K. Adams owner Malcolm Cooper, Sr. conceived of the first slanted knife block. His goal was to create a cutlery organizer that would hold knives at a low enough angle that they could be easily removed from the block when it was pushed back under a cabinet overhang. The J.K. Adams Kangaroo knife block was launched in 1980--the first-ever slanted knife block, and still the best. Recognizing the many opportunities to improve kitchen storage, J.K. Adams introduced the revolving \"carousel\" spice rack in 1982 followed by countless other well-designed storage products in the years since, including the popular in-drawer knife tray in 1994, a space-saving alternative to the knife block that offers the same safety and blade protection. In 2011, J.K. Adams takes cutlery storage to a new level once again with the new Universal knife block. For over 30 years, J.K. Adams has continued to lead and inspire the kitchen storage market with their innovative designs, superior hardwoods, and exemplary craftsmanship.  Today, J.K. Adams continues to provide innovative designs, superior hardwoods, and high-quality craftsmanship. J.K. Adams: Over 65 Years of New England Yankee Craftsmanship          Some of the world's finest woodworkers can be found in New England. The rich heritage and folklore of the great Yankee Woodworker is as well known today as it was hundreds of years ago, and the craft has been handed down through the generations. J.K. Adams' success is certainly attributable to the early Vermonters employed by the company while in its infancy who brought forth the techniques and quality craftsmanship that could only come from generations of shared knowledge and experience. The J.K. Adams factory has been at the same location since the beginning. As many as three generations of families have relied on J.K. Adams to provide for their families. Located in a rural area of Vermont, J.K. Adams remains one of the largest employers in the area and is an important pillar of support for the local community. J.K. Adams has always used the creativity and skill of their workforce in developing new products, and today J.K. Adams continues its New England craftsmanship with a wide variety of cutting boards, as well as wooden salad bowls, kitchen islands, and slate serving trays. And at the J.K. Adams factory, you'll find future generations of woodworkers building upon the traditions begun over 65 years ago. Cutting boards and other products by J.K Adams are made in the North America.     About J.K. Adams' Logo In colonial New England, three strokes of a broad ax were used to mark the finest trees in the forest for the Queens' Navy shipmasts. The broad arrow was adopted as our logo because it symbolizes the exceptional quality of wood that goes into our products. J.K. Adams' Company History  Started over 65 years ago in a small garage in Dorset, Vermont Cooper family purchased business from founder Josiah K. Adams in 1949 Began with the Speedy Racer toy, and then followed by manufacturing drafting and surveying tables, Kiwi shoe groomers, gifts, and furniture Now the leading supplier of wooden storage and food preparation products for the specialty housewares industry   Our Wood  Maple, Cherry, Walnut, Alder, Ash, and Hickory Either from New England or other North American sources Renewable and sustainable Hard and durable, yet forgiving to knife edges  Wood Grains End Grain  Prized for look and longest wear Identifiable by small pieces put together Board usually thick and heavy Many pieces, lots of glue joints, cracking can be a problem  Edge Grain  Most common in cutting boards Moderate grain pattern Stable with minimum glue joints  Why Choose a Wood Cutting Board? Wood is naturally anti-bacterial, and any bacteria left on the board will actually lessen in time versus multiplying on a plastic cutting board. A wooden board will also be more gentle on your knife's edge, and it just feels and sounds better under a knife. Caring for Your J.K. Adams Cutting Board Wash by hand in warm soapy water and dry thoroughly, and oil frequently with mineral oil to help give it an optimal appearance. Do not soak, microwave, freeze, or put in the dishwasher. For removing stains, you can use a weak bleach-and-water solution or a combination of lemon juice and salt. Be sure to rinse and wipe with mineral oil afterward. Additionally, the surface can be sanded to make the board look like new--although a board with wear will add character to your kitchen. For storage, keep the board away from strong sunlight as avoiding UV rays will reduce the risk of fading.   Environmental Responsibilities  We only purchase lumber from a select few suppliers who we are confident practice sustainable forestry practices Vermont forests are growing faster than they are being harvested J.K.

Innovative Kitchen-Storage Solutions In the late-1970's, when the gourmet-chef-tools market in the U.S. was still in its infancy, J.K.

His goal was to create a cutlery organizer that would hold knives at a low enough angle that they could be easily removed from the block when it was pushed back under a cabinet overhang. The J.K. Adams Kangaroo knife block was launched in 1980--the first-ever slanted knife block, and still the best. Recognizing the many opportunities to improve kitchen storage, J.K. Adams introduced the revolving \"carousel\" spice rack in 1982 followed by countless other well-designed storage products in the years since, including the popular in-drawer knife tray in 1994, a space-saving alternative to the knife block that offers the same safety and blade protection.

Adams: A 2nd-Generation, Family-Owned Company Kitchen storage solutions by J.K. Adams make it easy to save on valuable kitchen space while enjoying the best of USA-made craftsmanship. The family-owned company provides everything from pot hooks and spice bottles to wooden spice carousels, kitchen-knife blocks, bread boxes, wine racks, pot racks, and more. J.K. Adams' wooden kitchen items feature renewable and sustainable wood in Maple, Cherry, Walnut, Alder, Ash, or Hickory varieties. A thoughtful choice for gift giving, the high-quality kitchen items provide sleek designs and convenient functionality for year after year of everyday convenience. Innovative Kitchen-Storage Solutions In the late-1970's, when the gourmet-chef-tools market in the U.S. was still in its infancy, J.K. Adams owner Malcolm Cooper, Sr. conceived of the first slanted knife block. His goal was to create a cutlery organizer that would hold knives at a low enough angle that they could be easily removed from the block when it was pushed back under a cabinet overhang. The J.K. Adams Kangaroo knife block was launched in 1980--the first-ever slanted knife block, and still the best. Recognizing the many opportunities to improve kitchen storage, J.K. Adams introduced the revolving \"carousel\" spice rack in 1982 followed by countless other well-designed storage products in the years since, including the popular in-drawer knife tray in 1994, a space-saving alternative to the knife block that offers the same safety and blade protection. In 2011, J.K. Adams takes cutlery storage to a new level once again with the new Universal knife block. For over 30 years, J.K. Adams has continued to lead and inspire the kitchen storage market with their innovative designs, superior hardwoods, and exemplary craftsmanship.  Today, J.K. Adams continues to provide innovative designs, superior hardwoods, and high-quality craftsmanship. J.K.

It features a narrow sloping blade measuring 3 inches in length with a piercing tip. The paring knife's compact size allows for easy handling--ideal for tasks that require meticulous control and precision. Use it for intricate dicing and trimming tasks, as well as for peeling potatoes or removing the skin off peaches and pears. Overall, the paring knife measures approximately 8 by 1 by 1/2 inches. As part of Shun's Ken Onion collection, the knife shares the same high-quality materials as the Shun Classic line, but in a curvier form. Its enticing beauty starts with a VG-10 stainless-steel blade, which features 16 layers of SUS410/SUS431 stainless steel on each side, producing a 33 layered Damascus look, but without the rusting problems associated with Damascus. The Damascus detailing not only enhances the knife's aesthetic appeal, but it also prevents morsels from sticking and helps maintain the integrity of food when slicing. The knife's sleek good looks continue on into its ebony PakkaWood handle, which offers a generously arched, ergonomic shape that fits comfortably in the palm of the hand for enhanced comfort and control. The knife's wide, gently rounded bolster also helps ensure the correct grip, which alleviates hand strain even with large food-prep tasks. Made in Japan, the knife carries a limited lifetime warranty and should be hand washed for best results.  From the Manufacturer    Curved blade belly for versatility when working at a variety of heights.  Ken Onion Series Why Buy Shun Classic Ken Onion As part of the Shun Classic line, the Shun Classic Ken Onion Series shares the same materials and Pattern Damascus clad blades as Shun Classic. But the Ken Onion series elevates ergonomics to an art form. Every aspect, from the shape of the blade to the way the handle fits snugly into the user's hand, has been designed for superlative comfort and control. The arc of the sleek Pakkawood handle provides stability, while the rock of the blade's belly enables users of any height to cut with ease and control. The widened bolster guides users to the correct grip and reduces tension during cutting, making this line ideal for users who have large quantities of prep work or those who suffer from arthritis or carpal tunnel syndrome. NSF certified for use in commercial kitchens. Detailed Features   Similar to the Shun Classic line, but with a curvier profile.   Designed by Ken Onion, one of the most revered custom knife designers in the world. Ken has won more knife design awards than any other single blade designer. Designed by a man with no culinary experience, an advantage because he addressed the needs of chefs from a fresh perspective with no preconceived notions. The handsome, stick-resistant blade is combined with Ken Onion's signature ergonomic handle design and unique blade sweep found only in a Ken Onion knife. The shape of the blade is designed to maximize the glide of the blade across the cutting board, making it easy for chefs of any height to use without shoulder tension. Blunted blade nose, like that of a Santoku, allows the cook to scoop chopped ingredients off of the board. Ambidextrous handle design and stability bump on the lower portion of the handle provide maximum comfort and confidence while cutting. Inner curve on each side of the bolster forms perfect thumb and index finger rests; widened bolster releases tension in forearm. Knife is \"zero balanced\" at this center point, another distinctive ergonomic feature. Handle is curved downward to more closely match the shape of the palm, eliminating gaps between the hand and the handle. Handles are slightly elevated to allow for full contact between the knife and the cutting surface without the cook's knuckles getting in the way. Many of the 37 steps required to manufacture these truly unique knives utilize extensive hand crafting techniques, requiring trained craftsmen. Hand wash and dry recommended; limited lifetime warranty.    World-renown knife designer, Ken Onion.  Ken Onion Contrary to rumor, Ken Onion knives are not named for the singular task of chopping onions. That's really the designer's last name. Ken is one of the most sought-after custom knife makers in the world. He has won more knife awards for design than any other single designer, and with the partnership of Kershaw he has done more to change the pocket knife industry than any other individual. His custom knives can be found in some of the most prestigious private knife collections as well as in the pockets of his multitude of fans. Kasumi Method of Knifemaking Kasumi is a traditional Japanese style of knifemaking in which an extremely hard core of high-carbon steel is clad--that is, sheathed or covered--with an exterior jacket of another steel. The somewhat \"softer\" exterior cladding protects the inner cutting core. In Japanese, kasumi means \"mist\" and is so called because the exterior steel can have a lovely misty appearance when compared to the harder cutting core. Kasumi construction provides an ultimate mix of properties: an extremely sharp edge and ease of sharpening. This clad construction is similar to how samurai swords are traditionally made.

A quality mill with a specifically designed grinding mechanism will release the aromas and essential oils of that spice. Freshly ground pepper and spices have more aroma and better flavor than pre- ground. Another advantage of using freshly ground spices or minerals (salts) is the control a mill provides for determining the coarseness (size) of a grind. A high quality pepper, salt or spice mill gives you the ability to choose and change the coarseness according to taste or necessity.  How to Choose a Good Mill When looking for a pepper, salt or spice grinder, consider the following: Grinding mechanism: Choose a grinding mechanism that can withstand daily use: one that is well made and produces a consistent grind. Ideally, the grinding mechanism should be designed to handle a specific spice, as each spice has different physical characteristics that will benefit from different design features.  Design and appearance: Whether it's traditional or modern, manual or electric, a mill can be an indispensable tool in your kitchen and a beautiful part of table d\ufffdcor.  Ease of Use: A quality mill should be easy to adjust, easy to fill, and feel comfortable in the hand.  History of Peugeot Peugeot's story starts in the 19th century when the Peugeot brothers converted the family's gristmill into a steel foundry. They began producing award winning hand tools immediately after opening and went on to produce a diverse range of exceptional quality products including small appliances, bicycles and most notably, automobiles. (Although now operating as a separate company, the Peugeot car company continues the same commitment to quality and innovation that is a Peugeot hallmark). In 1840 Peugeot created their burr style coffee grinder and adopted that design to accommodate peppercorns in 1874. The resulting pepper mechanism design is still used today in every Peugeot pepper mill. Peugeot's iconic pepper grinding mechanism design is often copied, but never equaled. Today, Peugeot offers six unique spice-specific mechanisms plus the original burr-style coffee grinder. There are no shortcuts: each mechanism is designed to get the most out of the spices they are intended for. After more than 160 years, Peugeot mills and grinders remain the benchmark of the industry and have earned their position as the mill of choice in world class kitchens. It's All About the Mechanism  The primary difference between Peugeot and all other brands are the spice-specific mechanisms. Peugeot has 7 unique spice specific mechanisms for pepper, salt, herbs and spices, coffee, wet salt, chili peppers and nutmeg. For each spice, there is one - and only one - Peugeot grinding mechanism, each made of the ideal design and constructed from the best material available for its intended use. All Peugeot mechanisms are made in France and carry a lifetime limited warranty.    Peugeot's Pepper Grinding Mechanism is a two stage burr-style system. During production, the helix-shaped grooves and grinding teeth of the pepper mechanism are individually cut before the steel is case hardened to make it virtually indestructible. The mechanism is then given a proprietary treatment to provide additional protection against corrosion. During use, the helix- shaped grooves guide whole peppercorns through the mechanism to crack, then grind to a consistent size by a double row of teeth. This process releases the pepper's essential oils, resulting in more flavor and aroma for your dish. This patented mechanism is found on every Peugeot Pepper mill and is widely considered the best pepper mechanism available      Peugeot's Salt Crushing Mechanism features two ribbed plates which work to fracture and crush coarse, dry sea salt to a consistent size. The salt grinding mechanism is made of corrosion resistant Stainless Steel, and is found on every Peugeot Salt Mill.       A Peugeot Innovation u'Select is Peugeot's patented grind control system for electric and manual grinders. Beyond personal preferences, different stages of the preparation / cooking process and different dishes often call for seasonings of varying sizes. Peugeot now offers the ability to quickly, easily and accurately adjust the grind settings with its patented u'Select system.   From coarsely ground pepper or salt to very fine, u'Select offers: -6 pre-defined levels of grind for pepper, or any point in between. -6 pre-defined levels of grind for salt, or any point in between. Simplicity: just turn the ring at the base of the mill and select your grind size. The further you turn the ring, the finer or coarser the grind, depending on the direction turned. Precision: no risk that the grind will change during use.  The right grind: You are assured that with each setting, the grind will be consistent, time after time.     Fine or coarse grind-is it just a question of taste? Actually it depends on personal taste and the dish being prepared. While personal taste plays a role, some dishes call for coarse salt or pepper, whereas others require either or both to be finely ground. A finer grind will be used for a delicate sauce or mixed raw vegetables and a coarse grind for grilling a steak or when making heartier meats and dishes.    Anatomy of u'Select Mills These mills feature the innovative u'Select system. u'Select mills have the same renowned grinding mechanisms, beauty and functionality as classic Peugeot mills with an additional feature of easy grind selection. When you want to adjust the grind of your salt/pepper to more coarse or fine, you simply turn the u'Select ring at the base of the mill. You can select one of six pre-marked positions, or any point in between, for infinite possibilities. Your selection will not move or change until you want it to.    Manual MillsFor best grinding results: hold the mill body steady and turn mill top in a clockwise direction only    Electric Mills Press the Power switch to grind pepper or salt. Light will illuminate underneath mill when power switch is pressed. u'Select Ring:The narrower the wedge, the finer the grind.   Which pepper and which salt can be used in Peugeot Mills? Pepper:  To get the best results, we recommend you to use only dry, hard, whole peppercorns that are 5 mm (1/4\") or less in diameter. Black, white and dry green peppercorns can be ground in Peugeot pepper mills. Pink peppercorns can be ground only if in a blend (max 15% pink) with one of these other peppercorns. Dried coriander seeds are also suitable for the pepper mechanism.  Salt:  To get the best out of your Peugeot salt grinding mechanism, you should use: dry salt, ideally with a diameter of 4 mm (0.16\") such as coarse sea salt or rock salt (salt mined from an underground salt seam). Do not use your Peugeot salt mill for grinding pepper or any other spice, or damp sea salt (also known as grey salt, Guerande, Re, etc.) The moisture content is so high in damp salt that it will corrode the mill. Use a Peugeot Wet Salt mill with a mechanism specifically designed for damp salt. Its shape and materials have been designed to resist salt corrosion.
