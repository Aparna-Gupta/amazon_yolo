Convenient food-storage containers Airtight and watertight Made of high-quality BPA-free plastic Food-safe and hygienic 4-sided locking system with silicone seal Durable construction Stackable and nestable for space-saving storage Microwave- and dishwasher-safe Available in a variety of shapes and sizes    Lock&Lock Food-Storage Solutions Save Food, Save Money, Save Space A useful addition to any busy household, Lock&Lock's Classic plastic food-storage containers come in handy for storing fresh and frozen foods--from healthy snacks like cut-up fruits and vegetables to leftovers or dinners for the week. They also work well for keeping pasta, rice, flour, sugar, crackers, cookies, and other cupboard or pantry items fresh for longer, securely stored, and neatly organized. Even more, the versatile storage containers can be used to transport lunches to and from work or school--or even for storing smaller kitchen, office, or craft items. Lock&Lock's full line of Classic food-storage containers offers a wide range of shapes and sizes--each with a securely locking lid for airtight storage and peace of mind. Furthermore, the clear body of the containers makes identifying contents easy--no labels required.    Ideal for wet or dry food storage. Airtight Containers with Four-Sided Locking System    Lock&Lock's Classic food-storage containers feature an innovative four-sided locking system for an airtight seal and watertight storage so food stays fresh longer and there's no messy leaks or spills to worry about. The four sides of the locking system promote an airtight seal due to equal pressure to all four sides, along with the hollow-center silicon sealing ring that makes it possible to lock tightly (the silicone sealing ring can be removed for cleaning if necessary). Made of high-quality BPA-free plastic, Lock&Lock's Classic food-storage containers not only offer an airtight and watertight seal, but they're also durably built for unbreakable, long-lasting use and hygienic, food-safe storage. The containers can withstand temperatures ranging from -4 degrees F to 210 degrees F, making them suitable for use in the freezer, microwave* (reheating only), and dishwasher (top-rack). The base and lid should NOT be used in the oven, under browning elements, or on the stove top. Another thoughtful design detail includes the fact that the containers can be nested together, and with the lid in place, they can be stacked one on top of the other--particularly useful where space is limited. *Unlock all four latches and loosen lid before use in microwave. Detailed Features Patented Blocking Hole System    Consistent flow of resin--does not produce a weld line along the hinge. Inconsistent flow of resin--produces a weld line over time.   Lock&Lock Classic lids feature four side flaps or \"wings\" that are hinged and slightly flared at the end for an easy grip when opening. More importantly, they come with holes (rectangular-shaped openings) that line up with matching knobs on the base of the containers, making it easy to latch the lid to the base, locking it into place. This patented blocking hole system maintains the integrity of the lid and helps promote an easy, tightly locked container.  Lid's 4 wings come with holes that line up with base Weld line does not form around the hinge piece Hinge is designed to be short in length to prevent stiffness when opening and closing    Blue hollow-center silicon band in the lid helps create an airtight, leak-proof seal. Special Silicone In addition to its blocking hole system, the Classic food-storage containers feature a blue hollow-center silicon ring in the lid that helps create an airtight, leak-proof seal. Generic silicon with a solid center doesn't compress as well and doesn't have the same restorative power as hollow-center silicon, which means an inferior seal. Lock&Lock's hollow-center silicon seal delivers superior compression and restoration power that helps ensure an airtight seal. Permeability When testing the freshness of foods, one of the most important factors is the permeability of the container. In comparison to other brands, the permeability of Lock&Lock products showed to be drastically better.   Strawberries stored at room temperature for 5 days. The freshness test is determined throughout the world by how much moisture permeates various containers. Test results show Lock&Lock airtight containers allow in 3,000 - 6,000 times less moisture than other containers, making them far more airtight.   Airtight seal means no messy spills or leaks to worry about. Excellent Airtight Seal Lock&Lock airtight containers passed the leakage test. Their four-sided locking system makes an airtight seal possible due to equal pressure on all four sides and the hollow-center silicone sealing ring.   Passed the KEMTI bending test. Durable Design Lock&Lock airtight containers have also passed the KEMTI bending test. The container and the wing were fixed to the bending test machine and bent 3,000,000 times 80 degrees left to right. If the container were to be used 10 times a day, it could be used for 821 years (semi-permanently).   Hygienic and food-safe. Healthy Living Lock&Lock Classic food-storage containers have passed the strict hygiene and safety tests of the U.S. FDA and German SGS. Made of high-quality BPA-free plastic, the durable and heat-resistance containers are food-safe and health-friendly.   Nest and stack for space-saving storage. Space-Saving Design When not in use, the cleverly designed food-storage containers nest together, both lids and bases, for compact storage in a drawer or on a shelf. The containers also offer a stacking system for maximum space efficiency. The flat lids make it easy to stack one container on top of another--a slight edge helps to keep stacked items in securely place, whether in the freezer, refrigerator, or cupboard. Whether just one or building a collection of several, Lock&Lock's Classic airtight containers offer a smart solution for food storage.

With the ZeroWater Pitcher you can get cleaner, fresher water without tapping into your plumbing line, using bulky water coolers, and wasting your money on expensive bottled water. Thanks to an innovative five-stage filtration process, the ZeroWater Pitcher offers more complete water filtration than ordinary carbon filters. And for convenience, this pitcher neatly stores right in your refrigerator More Effective and Affordable Than Other Filters Even if you live in a municipality that cleans or treats water, water can pick up chemicals on its way from the treatment plant to your faucet, giving your tap water a metallic or chlorinated taste. Water that's purified with a ZeroWater Pitcher, however, tastes the way water should: crisp, clean, and fresh. Tested and certified by the Water Quality Association and NSF International for removal of several minerals, ZeroWater is the only filtration system that fits the FDA definition of purified bottled water. The ZeroWater pitcher not only improves the taste of your tap water, it also helps to improve the environment. When you use the ZeroWater Pitcher, you'll reduce your use of plastic water bottles that clog up landfills and harm ecosystems. You'll also contribute to water conservation, because unlike reverse-osmosis systems, ZeroWater is gravity operated and doesn't waste electricity or water.    A five-stage filtration process works to virtually remove all dissolved solids from water. Five-Stage Filtration System  At the heart of every drop of water that's purified by a ZeroWater Pitcher is an independent, laboratory-calibrated water tester called a TDS meter. TDS stands for \"Total Dissolved Solids\" and represents the amount of dissolved substances that can negatively affect the way water tastes. Stage 1: Activated carbon infused micro cloth Stage 2: Multi-layer system using carbon and oxidation reduces alloy Stage 3: Distributor that maximizes contact time Stage 4: Comprehensive ION Exchange array Stage 5: Non-woven membrane to remove fine particles     CERTIFIED CONTAMINANT REDUCTION    Brita ZeroWater   LEAD   \u2713   CHROMIUM, TRI AND HEXAVALANT   \u2713   HYDROGEN SULFIDE   \u2713   MERCURY \u2713 \u2713   CHLORINE TASTE & ODOR \u2713 \u2713     Unlike conventional gravity-fed or carbon water filters that remove only certain substances from your water, ZeroWater's patented Ion Exchange System with Five-Stage Technology delivers the only filtered water to measure absolute 000 PPM (parts per million) on the TDS meter. Compare that to the levels you\u2019ll find in other filtered waters, most bottled waters and plain unfiltered tap water, all of which contain measureable amounts of dissolved solids. TDS meter readings for tap water in the US average between 190 and 200 PPM. Conventional filtered water measures between 030-500 PPM, and bottled water between 000-350 PPM. Approximate quantity, in gallons, that a ZeroWater filter will provide based on the TDS level in your tap water:   TAP WATER TDS Description Quantity    No known municipalities N/A    Natural occuring only in a few cities. Can still have dangerous impurities such as lead. 40 gallons or more    Most water in the USA falls into this grouping. 25 to 40 gallons    Expect slightly lower capacity. 15 to 25 gallons    Most users will notice shorter filter life. 8 to 5 gallons    The highest TDS water. Expect lower capacity when reducing your water to 000. 8 gallons or less      The included TDS meter ensures that you're getting the best-tasting water possible. Battery-Powered TDS Meter Makes it Easy to Test Your Water The beauty of the ZeroWater Pitcher is that you don't have to accept purity claims at face value. Test your water yourself with the included meter and watch as the zeros come together to ensure that you're getting the best-tasting water possible.    Powered by two easy-to-replace 1.5-volt button cell batteries (included), this meter also lets you know the status of your filter. For instance, if your meter reads \"006,\" it's time to replace the filter.

Finished in highly refractive clear acrylic, each mill measures 4\u00bd\u2013inches tall.    A difference you can taste Seasoning can dramatically enhance the flavor of a dish. Finish your culinary masterpiece with a twist of freshly milled peppercorns or a dash of sea salt to fully enhance your flavor experience.  Optimum flavor delivery Rather than crushing peppercorns and releasing flavor quickly into the atmosphere, Cole & Mason's machine cut, hardened carbon steel pepper mechanism strips the peppercorns down layer by layer to ensure flavor and warmth is released slowly into food.  Superior milling performance Cole & Mason's Tap mills are fitted with design-registered, award-winning mechanisms that deliver optimum throughput - resulting in more grinds per turn.   High quality grinding mechanisms With machine cut, hardened carbon steel mechanisms for pepper and diamond-sharp ceramic mechanisms for salt, these mills feature best-in-class mechanisms to ensure hard-wearing properties maintain the ultimate in performance.   Fully adjustable from fine to coarse Some dishes require finely milled pepper (think savory dishes or soups), while others demand coarse grinds to add a more intense flavor (steaks, fish or pasta). The spring-loaded Cole & Mason mechanisms ensure consistent grinds and are fully adjustable so you can easily change from fine to coarse to suit your dish. Simply adjust the grind by turning the lug clockwise for a fine grind and counter-clockwise for a coarse grind.   Ergonomic handle design The faucet \"tap\" style handle is easy to grip and turn, making it ideal for those with limited hand mobility.  Easy to fill Unscrew the lug with a coin and remove faucet handle to fill. Cole & Mason recommends high-grade, low moisture peppercorns and Maldon Sea Salt Crystals or Cole & Mason brand sea salt for use in our mills. Rock salt and sea salt flakes or French Sal de Mer are not suitable for our mills. Rock salt will wear down the mechanism, whereas high-moisture flakes will coagulate in the mill.

Each blade from the stamped line of cutlery is expertly made in Switzerland from high-carbon stainless steel and undergoes a special tempering process for an edge that can be resharpened again and again. The result is a knife that can keep its original sharpness throughout the entire life of the blade. Each blade is conical ground throughout its length and depth, which results in a wider break point with less risk of the blade breaking and less resistance for easier cutting, and then laser tested to ensure optimum cutting power and durability. The blades are paired with classic, beautiful rosewood handles riveted for durability and designed to minimize wrist tension while offering a comfortable grip. The Victorinox stamped collection with rosewood handles is an extensive range with open-stock pieces as well as handy and versatile sets.  Enjoy professional quality cutlery in your home at an affordable price with this 11-piece block set from Victorinox. This set includes an 8-inch chef, 8-inch bread, 6-inch boning, 3-1/4-inch paring, and 10-inch slicing knives as well as four 5-1/4-inch steak knives and a 10-inch sharpening steel. The knives have gorgeous rosewood handles and are stored in a solid slant oak wood block. All high-quality cutlery and kitchen tools should be washed by hand for best care, and Victorinox covers each piece with a lifetime warranty against manufacturer defects.  What\u2019s in the Box 8-inch chef, 8-inch bread, 6-inch boning, 3-1/4-inch paring, and 10-inch slicing knives; four 5-1/4-inch steak knives; 10-inch sharpening steel; slant oak block  From the Manufacturer   Who is Victorinox? Although Victorinox is known the world over as the creator of the Original Swiss Army Knife, the company started out in 1884 as a cutlery workshop. By the time company creator Karl Elsener delivered his first pocket knife to the Swiss Army, his cutlery business was already booming. Over the next century, Victorinox cutlery became a top-rated choice among professionals worldwide, with over 300 blades to offer.  Victorinox knives have regularly appeared as highly ranked and recommended kitchen tools in Cook\u2019s Illustrated, Men\u2019s Health, The Cincinnati Enquirer, New York Magazine, and Natural Health, just to name a few. In 2009, the company announced a partnership with professional chef, Daniel Humm, of Eleven Madison Park in New York City. In addition, building on the success of its cutlery business, Victorinox has brought all the same quality and expertise to a wider range of products and accessories, including other kitchen tools, pocket tools, watches, luggage, and clothing.  Who is R.H. Forschner? Victorinox had been a staple in European commercial cutlery for over 50 years when approached by New York\u2019s R.H. Forschner, known since 1855 as a builder of scales for butchers, to be their sole cutlery supplier. The two companies joined forces in 1937, and R.H. Forschner subsequently became North America\u2019s dominant professional brand, as ubiquitous in the bustling meatpacking plants of the Midwest as it is in the gleaming, four-star restaurant kitchens of Midtown Manhattan.  As a division of Victorinox/Swiss Army Brands, R.H. Forschner marketed cutlery under the brand name \u201cRH Forschner by Victorinox\u201d and distributed to the commercial, food service, and retail trade classes. That brand has been considered a top choice of professionals worldwide with over 300 styles of blades bearing the R.H. Forschner name. However, in 2009, in conjunction with Victorinox\u2019s 125th anniversary, the company, Victorinox Swiss Army, Inc., has decided to remove the \u201cRH Forschner\u201d name from all blades. Blades thenceforth only include the \u201cVictorinox\u201d name.  What is a stamped blade? A stamped knife can usually be identified by the absence of a bolster. Stamped blades are cut into their shapes from cold-rolled pieces of steel and then ground, tempered, and sharpened. Creating them requires many less steps than forging and results in lighter, narrower blades. Some professionals prefer the thicker, heavier forged blades, but many pros, who spend much of their day cutting and slicing, enjoy a lighter knife since it\u2019s less fatiguing and easier to manipulate at speed.  Stamped knives are easier to produce and therefore less expensive. They perform very well and can approach the quality of a forged blade, but not the weight or feel. Victorinox manufactures a complete range of stamped blades with classic, beautiful Rosewood handles and they are considered among the greatest values in the knife industry.  What knives do I need to own? Knife choice or selection is determined by many factors--size, function, style, and preference. The most important factor is function. Different knives have different uses. It is important to use the proper knife for a specific task, since proper knife selection and the use of a proper-sized, sharp knife make for safe cutting. General kitchen tasks and the knife to use for them are as follows:  Paring: The most common to own and use, a paring knife is generally for small cutting jobs and peeling of vegetables or fruit. The blade size is usually from three to four inches. Choose the shape and size to fit your hand. Since this is one of the more versatile knives, owning more than one is recommended.  Chef's: The most important tool and essential to every cook, a chef\u2018s knife is most often used in a rocking method to mince, dice, and chop vegetables and herbs. This one is known as the chef\u2019s best friend.  Slicer: Most commonly used to slice meats, poultry, and seafood, the slicer is an important companion to any host or hostess.  Boning: As its name suggests, a boning knife is used to trim or remove meat and fish from the bone.  Bread: Designed with a special edge, a bread knife makes easy work of cutting through crusty bread, pastries, or any item with a crust and a soft interior.  Fillet: Most often used by pros and seasoned home chefs, the fillet knife is used to fillet meat and fish.  Cleaver: An important addition to any collection, a cleaver is often used to cut or chop through bones.  Santoku: This knife combines the features of a cleaver with a chef's knife. The curved blade helps the rocking motion used for chopping, and the wide blade works well for scooping sliced food off a cutting board and for crushing garlic. The santoku can also be used to slice meat and has a narrow spine for making thin cuts.  Utility: An all-purpose knife often referred to as a sandwich knife, the utility knife peels and slices fruits and vegetables, and even carves small meats.  Shaping: With its curved blade, a shaping knife is great for small precision cuts where control is essential, such as peeling, trimming, or garnishing.  What are the different knife edges and what do they do? Straight: The vast majority of Victorinox knives come with a straight or fine edge. This means it has a perfect taper along the blade and no serrations. It is designed to cut without tearing or shredding.  Serrated: An edge designed with small, jagged teeth along the edge.  Scalloped: A blade with waves along the edge generally used to cut breads with a hard crust and soft interior, as well as tougher-skinned fruits and vegetables.  Granton: This edge has hollowed-out grooves or dimples on the sides of the blade. These grooves fill with the fat and juices of the product being cut, allowing for thin, even cuts without tearing. Even with the grooves, these are still straight-edge knives and can be honed with a sharpening steel.  How should I care for my cutlery?  After use, knives should not be allowed to soak in water. The best practice is to hand wash and dry them immediately. This is especially true if they have been used on fruit or salty foods, which may cause some staining, even on stainless steel. Most knives require very little maintenance and it is worth the effort to protect your investment.  Though Victorinox knives are dishwasher safe, this is strongly discouraged. The dishwasher\u2019s agitation may cause damage. Additionally, harsh detergents can be harmful and cause pitting and spotting on the blades. The handles may also discolor and develop a white film with constant use of the dishwasher. Plus, intense heat associated with dishwashers is not good for the temper of the blade.  How do I keep my knives sharp? All quality knives require proper maintenance to keep them in perfect cutting shape. The best of edges will quickly dull if it strikes metal, glass, or Formica. A wooden cutting board makes the best cutting surface. And, if a slip occurs, a proper cutting board is safer for the user. Frequent use of a Victorinox sharpening steel will keep blades in tip top working condition. All straight-edge knives need steeling to keep their edges.   How to \"Steel\" a Knife 1. Hold the steel firmly in your left hand with the guard positioned to stop the blade should it slip. 2. Hold the knife in your right hand and place on top part of steel as shown. 3. Raise back of blade one-eighth inch. 4. Now, moving the blade only, draw it across the steel in an arching curve, pivoted at your wrist. The blade tip should leave the steel about two-thirds of the way down. 5. Repeat the same action with the Blade on the bottom side of the steel. Always maintain the same pressure and angle on both sides of the steel. 6. Repeat five or six times.  When a sharpening steel no longer does the job, it\u2019s time to take the knife to a qualified knife sharpener who will place a new edge on it. This, along with use of the sharpening steel, will give you many years of sharp, safe blades.  Please note that electric knife sharpeners can be harmful. They have to be used carefully as they remove too much metal, can harm the temper of the blade, and most important can change the factory-applied edge angle.  How should I store my knives?  Safety is the biggest concern of storage, both to the user and to protect the knife's edge. Choices include a knife magnet, knife block, drawer insets, and also individual knife protectors.", "salesrank_2018": "325013"}, "B001DCX632": {"description": "Riccar RZH-6 Bags", "salesrank_2018": "447202"}, "B001DCYQCC": {"description": "6-Pack of genuine HEPA media type H bags.", "salesrank_2018": "515575"}, "B001DD24MK": {"description": "The Wusthof Gourmet 2piece Knife block starter set includes a 22 slot beechwood swivel block has room for 2 cooks knivse, 8 steak knives and a notched slot that can hold a shear, fork or knife.

Carpet Cleaning FAQs Deep cleaning is a carpet cleaning process that loosens and removes harmful dirt and ground-in grit that could otherwise cause serious harm to carpet fibers. Carpet deep cleaning helps protects your flooring and keep it looking its best for years to come. Everyone should perform a deep cleaning regimen two times a year, but if you have pets and children you may want to consider doing it a few more times. How to get the best results with your deep cleaner  It\u2019s time to go beyond vacuuming since vacuuming alone isn\u2019t enough. Our carpet cleaning systems are engineered to reach the ground-in dirt and stains left behind by ordinary vacuums. And what\u2019s best of all? It\u2019s as easy as pushing a vacuum! Bring on your deepest clean by first vacuuming the area to be deep cleaned. Next, pre-treat badly stained areas with a specialized pre-treat formula. Continue by filling your clean water tank with hot tap water and the recommended cleaning solution. Then, while pressing the trigger make one slow forward and backward wet pass. To suction the water in your carpet, make these slow forward and backward passes on the same area without pressing the trigger. Repeating this multiple times will help aid in dry time. Once your carpet is dry, vacuum again.Carpet cleaning is an effective way to prolong the look of your carpet and upholstery. BISSELL experts recommend carpet cleaning at least twice per year and more often if you have children, pets, allergies or smoke.        The advantages of heated cleaning The ProHeat carpet cleaner has a built-in heater to heat tap water up to 25 degrees hotter for optimum cleaning.

AnySharp works on virtually any knife, including expensive hardened steel knives and even serrated blades (like bread knives and hunting knives), making it unlike any knife sharpener, steel or sharpening stone you've ever used. The unique, patented AnySharp uses tungsten carbide technology to extend the life of almost any knife. AnySharp's unique safety feature is its PowerGrip suction cup base, which attaches securely to any smooth surface or worktop without the need for any tools. Once it's attached you can sharpen any knife safely single handed - keeping your free hand out of harm's way! With a totally blunt knife, AnySharp will hone it to a perfect angle, and remove excess metal rapidly the first time you use it. Once sharp, better results are gained by using only light pressure, and only microscopic amounts of metal are shed. All you need to do is just gently draw the blade through the tungsten carbide sharpening edges, 3 or 4 times to restore a super sharp cutting edge. The AnySharp has a long-lasting polymer guiding top that is softer than metal, and therefore won't damage the metal edge, making it safe for your knives too.

They also work well for keeping pasta, rice, flour, sugar, crackers, cookies, and other cupboard or pantry items fresh for longer, securely stored, and neatly organized. Even more, the versatile storage containers can be used to transport lunches to and from work or school--or even for storing smaller kitchen, office, or craft items. Lock&Lock's full line of Classic food-storage containers offers a wide range of shapes and sizes--each with a securely locking lid for airtight storage and peace of mind. Furthermore, the clear body of the containers makes identifying contents easy--no labels required.    Ideal for wet or dry food storage. Airtight Containers with Four-Sided Locking System    Lock&Lock's Classic food-storage containers feature an innovative four-sided locking system for an airtight seal and watertight storage so food stays fresh longer and there's no messy leaks or spills to worry about. The four sides of the locking system promote an airtight seal due to equal pressure to all four sides, along with the hollow-center silicon sealing ring that makes it possible to lock tightly (the silicone sealing ring can be removed for cleaning if necessary). Made of high-quality BPA-free plastic, Lock&Lock's Classic food-storage containers not only offer an airtight and watertight seal, but they're also durably built for unbreakable, long-lasting use and hygienic, food-safe storage. The containers can withstand temperatures ranging from -4 degrees F to 210 degrees F, making them suitable for use in the freezer, microwave* (reheating only), and dishwasher (top-rack). The base and lid should NOT be used in the oven, under browning elements, or on the stove top.

The coating is also water-based, unlike other nonstick coatings on the market, which are solvent-based. In addition, Cuisinart's cookware has a scratch-resistant nonstick surface that won't peel off. The new cookware conforms to FDA and European RoHS standards for environmentally sound products. These pans should be hand-washed with a mild detergent. Cuisinart also gets some green cred from the packaging, which is made from 100 percent recycled materials and is printed using 100 percent biodegradable soy ink.  The pans deliver superior heat conductivity, requiring less energy to achieve the desired cooking temperature. Harder than stainless steel, the skillet's hard anodized exterior is dense, nonporous, and highly wear-resistant for extra durability and professional performance as well as quick and even heat distribution. Additionally, the securely riveted stay-cool steel handles are manufactured using 70 percent recycled stainless steel and is oven-safe to 500 degrees F, so food can be browned on the stovetop then transferred to the oven to finish cooking.

Product Features    Riveted stainless stick handles stay cool on the stovetop  Petroleum-Free ceramic-based nonstick interior helps to conserve oil consumption  Exclusive Cuisinart Ceramica Nonstick Technology  Oven and broiler safe  Packaging is made from 100% recycled materials and is printed with soy ink      Handles are made from 70% recycled stainless steel Features and Benefits Healthy Cooking, Easy Cleaning: When cooking with your Cuisinart GreenGourmet Cookware, you do not need to add oil or butter to prevent foods from sticking. If you wish to enhance the flavor and appearance of foods, you need add only a minimum amount to the nonstick surface of your cookware. Energy-Efficient Cooking: Select a burner size that matches the diameter of the bottom of the pan. When cooking over a gas burner, make certain that the flame touches only the bottom of the pan. If the flame extends up the sides of the pan, energy is wasted.  Easy Maintenance: Let your Cuisinart GreenGourmet Cookware cool before cleaning. Cookware should be washed by hand with hot sudsy water and a sponge or soft dishcloth. Do not use steel wool or other metal or abrasive pads that can scratch your cookware. After washing, rinse thoroughly and dry immediately.  Cleaning the Exterior: Cuisinart GreenGourmet Cookware has a smooth exterior finish, making it easier to clean and maintain. Food residue or buildup on the exterior of your cookware can easily be removed with hot soapy water and a scrub pad. The exterior of Cuisinart Cookware, like other brands, will show wear with continuous use. This condition will not in any way affect the superior cooking performance of your cookware.  Convenient Storage: Cuisinart GreenGourmet Cookware has a smooth exterior finish, making it easier to clean and maintain. Food residue or buildup on the exterior of your cookware can easily be removed with hot soapy water and a scrub pad. The exterior of Cuisinart Cookware, like other brands, will show wear with continuous use. This condition will not in any way affect the superior cooking performance of your cookware.  Proper Cooking Utensils We recommend using plastic or wooden utensils in your Cuisinart GreenGourmet Cookware to maintain its appearance and performance. Refrain from cutting foods or using sharp utensils such as forks, knives, mashers or whisks that can scratch the cooking surface. Slight surface marks and abrasions are normal and will not affect the performance of the Cuisinart Ceramica coating. Durable Cookware for a Lifetime of Great Meals With a little bit of care, you\u2019ll enjoy a great performance from your Cuisinart GreenGourmet cookware for years to come. A careful hand washing after each use is usually all it takes. But if pans become crusty or heavily greased, a couple of hours soaking in hot sudsy water and a light scrub will have them looking like new. Seasoning your pans twice a year helps to maintain optimal performance, and it\u2019s easy! Just add a half-tablespoon of vegetable oil and spread it around the entire interior, right up to the rim. Then place the pan in a preheated 300\u00b0F oven for an hour. Carefully remove the pan, allow it to cool completely, and wipe off any excess oil with a paper towel. Be gentle with your cookware! Avoid stacking, which may cause chipping of the ceramic interior. Show it off on a Cuisinart cookware rack, or store it carefully, with a little breathing room, in your kitchen cabinets.

(Hence the assertions that Socrates quaffed his hemlock poison from a Guild-designed chalice, though vigorous debate surrounds the question of whether it was a \"disappearing\" chalice.) Others argue that the UPG dates from the High Middle Ages, when the Philosophers Guild entered the world of commerce by selling bawdy pamphlets to pilgrims facing long lines for the restroom. Business boomed until 1211 when Pope Innocent III condemned the publications. Not surprisingly, this led to increased sales, even as half our membership was burned at the stake. More recently, revisionist historians have pinpointed the birth of the Guild to the time it was still cool to live in New York City's Lower East Side.

With streamlined thermal carafe, it's a beautiful addition to any kitchen. A perfect addition to any modern kitchen, this 10-cup automatic coffeemaker grinds whole beans right before brewing to produce a fresh and flavorful pot of coffee.

In addition, its brew-pause function makes it simple to sneak a cup before the end of the brewing cycle.  The Grind & Brew Coffeemaker features a separate grinding assembly and filter chamber to make beans easy to add and used grounds easy to remove. A convenient \"grind off\" control turns the grinder off when preground coffee is used.  Smaller amounts can be brewed without any loss of flavor thanks to the units 1- to 4-cup setting. For added convenience, the coffeemaker provides a large control panel, adjustable automatic shut-off from zero to four hours, and a 10-cup (5 ounces each) double-wall thermal carafe with a generous stay-cool handle and drip-free pouring spout.

The quality of that water is as important as the quality of your coffee. If water doesn't taste good from the tap, it won't taste good in your coffee. That's why Cuisinart has added a water filter to the Grind & Brew Coffeemaker. The charcoal filter removes chlorine, bad tastes, and odors, for the purest coffee flavor, every time you brew.  Element 2: Coffee While coffee is 98% water, all of the flavor comes from the beans. To achieve the same great taste you enjoy at a coffee bar, you need to use the same quality of coffee.  Buy the beans fresh and whole, only about two weeks' supply at a time for maximum freshness. Once the coffee bean is broken, its flavor degrades very quickly. That's why the Grind & Brew grinds your coffee just prior to brewing. If it is not practical to buy small supplies, separate larger amounts of beans into one to two week portions immediately after purchase, and freeze them in airtight containers.  The best way to maximize freshness is to minimize exposure to air, light, and moisture. So, once beans have been removed from the freezer, maintain them in a sealed container at room temperature, since damaging condensation occurs every time the beans are removed from the freezer or refrigerator. Note that some coffee experts advise against freezing dark-roast beans, because freezing can cause the oils to coagulate. Other experts disagree. We suggest you experiment and decide for yourself. Element 3: Grind The grind is critical for proper flavor extraction. If the grind is too fine, over-extraction and bitterness will result. Too fine a grind may also clog the filter. If grind is too coarse, the water will pass through too quickly and the maximum flavor will not be extracted. The Grind & Brew is preset for a medium grind, the optimal grind for this type of coffeemaker.  Element 4: Proportion Coffee that is too strong or too weak is always a disappointment. Follow the recommended portions of ground coffee in the instructions included with every Grind & Brew, and later adjust the amount to suit your taste. The Grind & Brew makes up to twelve (12) 5-ounce cups of coffee   ", "salesrank_2018": "4490"}, "B001G8Y2X6": {"description": " Grind and Brew Coffeemaker   Retire your alarm clock and wake up instead to the rich aroma of freshly ground, just brewed coffee, with the Cuisinart Grind & Brew Automatic Coffeemaker.

Why is clay better? The unique properties of clay make it ideal for flavor enhanced cooking without added salt, sugar or oils.  Clay is porous. Heat and moisture circulate through the pot during cooking, unlike metal or enamel-lined pots; Clay acts as a natural insulator that holds and absorbs heat to cook foods slowly and evenly bringing out earthy flavors and textures. Naturally thermal, clay cooks 4 times faster and stays warm longer. Cut your energy usage in half. Clay is alkaline. Clay interacts with acidity in the food, neutralizing the pH balance. Highly acidic foods like tomato sauce will become naturally sweet when cooked in clay. Foods cooked in clay taste more robust with authentic flavors and textures.

With VitaClay Technology, you can make a host of important changes\u2014all in one\u2013 while saving yourself precious time and money.

According to The U.S. EPA, \"air within homes and other buildings can be more seriously polluted than the outdoor air in even the largest and most industrialized cities.\" Common sources of indoor air pollution include: Radon, Environmental Tobacco Smoke (ETS), Biological Contaminants, Stoves, Fireplaces, Household Products, Formaldehyde, Pesticides, Asbestos, and Lead. To make things worse, Americans now spend 90 percent of their time indoors. Constantly breathing polluted indoor air imperils our health and even dampens our spirits. Fortunately there is a solution . . . Ionization. Ionization works by generating negative ions to counteract pollutants. The negative ions bind to positively-charged unwanted particles, reversing their polarity so they drop to the nearest surface or are neutralized. Negative ions increase oxygen intake and stimulate alertness and vitality, like breathing mountain air. The ionizers developed and manufactured by Wein Products are the Gold Standard in air ionizers. Since 1967, Wein Products has been the leading innovator of this technology.

It's also non -porous so it won't trap odors or food particles and provides a low coefficient of friction, meaning that it cleans up easily and, it is corrosion and chemically resistant so it will last a long time.

A quality mill with a specifically designed grinding mechanism will release the aromas and essential oils of that spice. Freshly ground pepper and spices have more aroma and better flavor than pre- ground. Another advantage of using freshly ground spices or minerals (salts) is the control a mill provides for determining the coarseness (size) of a grind. A high quality pepper, salt or spice mill gives you the ability to choose and change the coarseness according to taste or necessity.  How to Choose a Good Mill When looking for a pepper, salt or spice grinder, consider the following: Grinding mechanism: Choose a grinding mechanism that can withstand daily use: one that is well made and produces a consistent grind. Ideally, the grinding mechanism should be designed to handle a specific spice, as each spice has different physical characteristics that will benefit from different design features.  Design and appearance: Whether it's traditional or modern, manual or electric, a mill can be an indispensable tool in your kitchen and a beautiful part of table d\ufffdcor.  Ease of Use: A quality mill should be easy to adjust, easy to fill, and feel comfortable in the hand.  History of Peugeot Peugeot's story starts in the 19th century when the Peugeot brothers converted the family's gristmill into a steel foundry. They began producing award winning hand tools immediately after opening and went on to produce a diverse range of exceptional quality products including small appliances, bicycles and most notably, automobiles. (Although now operating as a separate company, the Peugeot car company continues the same commitment to quality and innovation that is a Peugeot hallmark). In 1840 Peugeot created their burr style coffee grinder and adopted that design to accommodate peppercorns in 1874. The resulting pepper mechanism design is still used today in every Peugeot pepper mill. Peugeot's iconic pepper grinding mechanism design is often copied, but never equaled. Today, Peugeot offers six unique spice-specific mechanisms plus the original burr-style coffee grinder. There are no shortcuts: each mechanism is designed to get the most out of the spices they are intended for. After more than 160 years, Peugeot mills and grinders remain the benchmark of the industry and have earned their position as the mill of choice in world class kitchens. It's All About the Mechanism  The primary difference between Peugeot and all other brands are the spice-specific mechanisms. Peugeot has 7 unique spice specific mechanisms for pepper, salt, herbs and spices, coffee, wet salt, chili peppers and nutmeg. For each spice, there is one - and only one - Peugeot grinding mechanism, each made of the ideal design and constructed from the best material available for its intended use. All Peugeot mechanisms are made in France and carry a lifetime limited warranty.    Peugeot's Pepper Grinding Mechanism is a two stage burr-style system. During production, the helix-shaped grooves and grinding teeth of the pepper mechanism are individually cut before the steel is case hardened to make it virtually indestructible. The mechanism is then given a proprietary treatment to provide additional protection against corrosion. During use, the helix- shaped grooves guide whole peppercorns through the mechanism to crack, then grind to a consistent size by a double row of teeth. This process releases the pepper's essential oils, resulting in more flavor and aroma for your dish. This patented mechanism is found on every Peugeot Pepper mill and is widely considered the best pepper mechanism available      Peugeot's Salt Crushing Mechanism features two ribbed plates which work to fracture and crush coarse, dry sea salt to a consistent size. The salt grinding mechanism is made of corrosion resistant Stainless Steel, and is found on every Peugeot Salt Mill.       A Peugeot Innovation u'Select is Peugeot's patented grind control system for electric and manual grinders. Beyond personal preferences, different stages of the preparation / cooking process and different dishes often call for seasonings of varying sizes. Peugeot now offers the ability to quickly, easily and accurately adjust the grind settings with its patented u'Select system.   From coarsely ground pepper or salt to very fine, u'Select offers: -6 pre-defined levels of grind for pepper, or any point in between. -6 pre-defined levels of grind for salt, or any point in between. Simplicity: just turn the ring at the base of the mill and select your grind size. The further you turn the ring, the finer or coarser the grind, depending on the direction turned. Precision: no risk that the grind will change during use.  The right grind: You are assured that with each setting, the grind will be consistent, time after time.     Fine or coarse grind-is it just a question of taste? Actually it depends on personal taste and the dish being prepared. While personal taste plays a role, some dishes call for coarse salt or pepper, whereas others require either or both to be finely ground. A finer grind will be used for a delicate sauce or mixed raw vegetables and a coarse grind for grilling a steak or when making heartier meats and dishes.    Anatomy of u'Select Mills These mills feature the innovative u'Select system. u'Select mills have the same renowned grinding mechanisms, beauty and functionality as classic Peugeot mills with an additional feature of easy grind selection. When you want to adjust the grind of your salt/pepper to more coarse or fine, you simply turn the u'Select ring at the base of the mill. You can select one of six pre-marked positions, or any point in between, for infinite possibilities. Your selection will not move or change until you want it to.

Pepper:  To get the best results, we recommend you to use only dry, hard, whole peppercorns that are 5 mm (1/4\") or less in diameter. Black, white and dry green peppercorns can be ground in Peugeot pepper mills. Pink peppercorns can be ground only if in a blend (max 15% pink) with one of these other peppercorns. Dried coriander seeds are also suitable for the pepper mechanism.  Salt:  To get the best out of your Peugeot salt grinding mechanism, you should use: dry salt, ideally with a diameter of 4 mm (0.16\") such as coarse sea salt or rock salt (salt mined from an underground salt seam). Do not use your Peugeot salt mill for grinding pepper or any other spice, or damp sea salt (also known as grey salt, Guerande, Re, etc.) The moisture content is so high in damp salt that it will corrode the mill. Use a Peugeot Wet Salt mill with a mechanism specifically designed for damp salt. Its shape and materials have been designed to resist salt corrosion.

The fresh butter maker is easy enough for the whole family to use and is perfect for incorporating kids into the kitchen. Simple to Use Bring 17-27 ounces of cream to a temperature of 65 degrees Fahrenheit. The temperature is vital in the butter making process. Cream that is too warm will not separate properly, and cream that is too cold will create whipped cream. It is recommended that you take the cream out of the refrigerator about two hours prior to churning. Pour the cream into the glass jar and secure the lid and crank mechanism onto the jar. Turn the crank steadily to begin thickening the cream. After a few minutes, you will notice it becomes more difficult to turn the crank as quickly or smoothly. Allow your churning speed to slow as the solids separate. When it becomes difficult to turn the crank, stop rotating the handle and unscrew the top. Pour out the solids and liquid into a fine mesh strainer and rinse under cold water. The whey (white liquid) will drain off and leave you with the solids you will knead into butter.  Place the solids on a dry board or silicone matt. If desired, season with a pinch of kosher or sea salt and minced fresh herbs. Gently knead the solids to remove excess moisture. Move the butter to dry surface areas as the liquids are released. You will notice the solids come together into a smooth and creamy butter. Shape and wrap the butter, then store in the refrigerator or freezer.   Additional tips:  Use a cream that contains at least 30% fat. Churning process takes 3-8 minutes. Butter can be easily seasoned to achieve sweet or savory flavor.   ", "salesrank_2018": "244491"}, "B001HN5G3U": {"description": "Deco Lace are doilies all dressed up, with everywhere to go!

The Pet Series robots come equipped with an extra set of easy to clean brushes, two interchangeable debris bins for trapping even more pet hair, kitty litter or dander and cleaning tools that ensure both sets of brushes remain free of debris for optimal performance. The high capacity sweeper bin holds three- and -a-half times more debris than the vacuum bin. Counter-rotating brushes reach deep into carpets to pull out pet hair, dander and more. Cleaning up to three standard-sized rooms on a single charge, it comes standard with two Virtual Walls that use infrared beams that creates and adjustable, invisible barrier that blocks Roomba from entering off-limit areas. When the cleaning is done, or the battery is running low, Roomba automatically locates and returns to its Home Base to dock and recharge. Roomba efficiently vacuums dirt, debris, pet hair, pet dander, dust, allergens and more from carpets and hard floors. Extra replacement filters ensure Roomba traps dust, pollen, pet dander and tiny particulate inside the bin. The Roomba 532 also includes iRobot's latest technological innovations, such as a light-touch bumper, stair sensing ability, advanced anti-tangle technology and the ability to transition from carpets to hard flooring with ease. Most pets are initially curious about Roomba but will quickly learn to ignore it-or even play with it. Special safety features help your pet safe: Stair-avoiding system, bump sensors and automatic shut-off so noses and paws won't be harmed if a curious pet flips Roomba over. You should run Roomba while you are at home for the first few cleaning cycles so your pet can get used to it.

It\u2019s vented for a smooth, perfect pour that\u2019s splash and drip free. No more stained tablecloths! It\u2019s specially designed to aerate newly opened bottles and release wine\u2019s full aroma and flavor instantly. Aerating wine, swirling it in a glass or letting it \u201cbreathe\u201d in a wine decanter, is an important step in developing its bouquet and softening its flavor when a bottle is first opened. Avoiding exposure to an abundance of oxygen is equally important, if consuming it at a later date. Exposure to oxygen for long periods of time deteriorates wine\u2019s quality and taste. Wine corks allow oxygen to re-enter the bottle, causing the wine to spoil quickly. Haley\u2019s Corker aerates wine instantly, and filters out cork residue, sediment and tartrates all at once, while it pours. Its leak-free cap reseals opened bottles to protect contents and keep them fresher longer. It\u2019s great for keeping out debris and bugs for effortless outdoor entertaining. When ready for another glass, simply lift the cap, pour a glass, and press closed to reseal. It\u2019s perfect for drip-free pouring and to re-cork unfinished liquors and spirits, coffee syrups, champagne, sparkling water, extra virgin olive oil, or EVOO, canola oil, and vegetable oil, plus balsamic vinegar, and more to preserve and extend freshness.

The 233 thread-count 80% poly/20% cotton dobby stripe shell is incredibly soft, soothing and supportive. Constructed within the pad is the patented Safe & Warm low-voltage technology. This low-voltage mattress pad includes a small power supply box that changes 120 volt AC home current into non-hazardous low voltage DC current (very similar to a battery) to provide warmth, protection and safety even if the pad becomes wet. Unlike other warming pads with their thick bulky wires, the heating wires in the Soft Heat pads are so small, they are virtually unnoticeable. During construction we place the ultra thin wires 3-inches apart and evenly distribute them from head to toe. The benefit to you is a pad that gives more of an even heat and has no annoying hot or cold spots. The twin size pad comes standard with one easy to read, easy to turn, non-slip computerized controller to adjust the temperature of the pad. For cozy sheets before bed time, it has an automatic pre-heat and hold feature. You simply turn it on and the pad will warm up on HI until it reaches the temperature that you pre set your dial on, and then adjusts itself to hold it there. For your safety convenience and power conservation, it has an automatic shut off feature that will shut the pad off after 10 hours just in case you forget. It also comes standard with built in over-temperature protection for that extra bit of safety and peace of mind. On the controller, a giant backlit display with auto dimming feature provides more convenience for night time adjustments with out having to turn on the lights.

This Japanese Gokujo knife by Shun features a 6-inch blade designed specifically for the task of boning and filleting fish. The knife's strong blade provides an elegantly contoured shape that makes it easy to safely and efficiently cut meat away from joints, bones, and tendons, all while maintaining the integrity of the meat. Overall, the knife measures approximately 11 by 8/9 by 1-4/5 inches. Like other knives in Shun's Classic collection, the knife comes precision-forged in Japan by renowned blade manufacturer KAI. Its eye-catching beauty starts with a VG-10 stainless-steel blade, which features 16 layers of SUS410 high-carbon stainless steel on each side, producing a 33 layered Damascus look, but without the rusting problems associated with Damascus. The Damascus detailing not only enhances the knife's aesthetic appeal, but it also prevents morsels from sticking and reduces drag when slicing. The knife's sleek good looks continue on into its handle. Offering a D-shaped design for a comfortable grip, the unique ebony Pakkawood handle consists of a fused blend of hardwood veneers and resin to exceptionally noteworthy results. Its steel end-cap offers an attractive finishing touch, and the knife carries a limited lifetime warranty. Though dishwasher-safe, Shun recommends washing the knife by hand for best results.  From the Manufacturer  Shun Classic Cutlery    View larger.  Why Buy Shun Classic: Born of the ancient samurai-sword-making tradition and hand-finished for precision and beauty, Shun Classic is an ideal choice for anyone buying their first Japanese knife or 50th. The high-quality line of cutlery makes a worthwhile addition to any chef's arsenal of tools--it's used by professional chefs and home cooks alike. Produced in the widest variety of specialized styles, the Classic line features both traditional European blade shapes and innovative cutting-edge designs. Shun Classic's amazingly sharp blade is famous for both edge retention and ease of sharpening. Each blade has a core of VG-10 \"Super Steel\" with a Pattern Damascus cladding of 32 layers of high-carbon stainless steel--16 layers on either side. While the wood grain pattern enhances the knife's beauty, it also adds durability and stain resistance, and reduces friction when cutting. NSF certified for use in commercial kitchens. Detailed Features  Blade core consists of high-carbon VG-10, a Japanese super steel known for its edge retention, allowing the knives to hold their sharp edges for years. Blades boast a 16-degree angle, making these the sharpest knives out of the box. This is sharper than traditional European blades, which are usually sharpened to 20-22 degrees. Clad with 16 layers of SUS410/SUS431 Pattern Damascus stainless steel on each side for strength and flexibility. This metal is corrosion-resistant and easy to maintain. Damascus styling adds to the beauty of the knife while the microscopic air pockets created by the cladding process reduces friction during slicing. D-shaped handle fits in the palm and provides comfort and control, keeping the knife's handle secure in the hand during use. Available standard in D-shaped handle styles or by special order in reverse D-shaped handle styles. Pakkawood handles, made of resin-impregnated hardwood, are NSF Certified for use in commercial kitchens. Produced in Seki City, Japan, the capital of samurai sword manufacturing. Rockwell hardness rating of 60-61 ensures that it takes and holds its incredibly sharp edge longer. Hand wash and dry recommended; limited lifetime warranty.    Specifications   Blade Material: VG-10 hardened Japanese steel cutting core, clad with 16 layers of SUS410/SUS431 Pattern Damascus stainless steel on each side, for a total of 33 layers of metal.   Bevel: Double-beveled   Cutting angle: 16 degrees per side (comprehensive angle 32 degrees). This is sharper than European knives, ground to 20-22 degrees per side.    Handle Material: PakkaWood (resin-impregnated hardwood); D-Shaped handle available in right and (by special order) left-handed versions.    Sharpening recommendations: Weekly honing to maintain the blade, sharpening as needed with professional sharpener or Asian-style electric sharpener.     Professional Manufacturing    View larger.
