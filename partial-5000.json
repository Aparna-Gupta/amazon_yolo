The Granite Ware 20-quart Pressure Canner and Pressure Cooker/Steamer is a professional-quality tool, UL-listed, and made of hard anodized aluminum, with stay-cool handles and a locking stainless steel lid. An accompanying rack fits down into the pot to keep jars up off the bottom, and comes with folding handles for easy raising and lowering. The rack holds up to 7 one-quart jars, 8 one-pint jars or 24 half-pint jars. The steamer insert fits into the stepped portion of the vessel about 1/3 the way up from the bottom to hold foods out of the cooking liquid and can handle all your large capacity steaming needs \u2013 for tamales, seafood, pulled pork, pot roast, ribs, and more. The pressure canner achieves the high temperature required for safely processing foods with the USDA endorsing it as the only safe method for canning meats, poultry, and low-acid vegetables. It can also be used as a large pressure cooker for any meal that needs to come together quickly. This Granite Ware pressure cooker preserves flavor and nutrients, tenderizes tough cuts of meat, and cooks many foods in one-third to one-tenth the time compared to traditional methods, and is large enough to create family-sized meals with ease. The unit features a pop-up pressure indicator, locking the lid in place. It cannot be opened while the canner is pressurized, even if there is just one psi of pressure. The vent pipe is located in the center of the lid and if it fails or clogs, there is an additional black capped safety valve set to go off and a second all metal safety valve will exhaust residual pressure while sounding a whistling alarm. The sturdy lid locks in place during canning or cooking with the lid gasket sealing ring forming a pressure tight seal between the body of the canner and the cover during use. The Granite Ware pressure canner, steamer, and cooker uses the UL-recommended adjustable 3-piece pressure regulator system. The pressure regulator is calibrated for three different pressure levels at 5 psi, 10 psi and 15 psi, which is ideal for canning at different altitudes.

Conventional pans often achieve their non-stick performance with the aid of PFOA (PerFluoroOctanoic Acid), a potential carcinogen which the EPA has classified as a 'persistent pollutant of the environment', and APEO (Alkylphenol ethoxylates), which are under restricted use in Germany due to environmental concerns about their poor biodegradability and toxicity in the food chain. According to the EPA, once ingested, PFOA is capable of remaining in people for a very long time, and has been shown to cause developmental and other adverse effects in laboratory animals. Likewise, European studies have shown that APEO may be toxic to aquatic life, and has the potential to act as endocrine disrupters. With the Stone Earth Pan's stone-derived coating from Germany, no such controversial chemicals are ever passed on to you, or released into the environment. This is because the Stone Earth Pan utilizes an inert coating inspired by nature, and applied using a water based Sol Gel Technique that is free of the lesser known but potentially harmful chemicals NMP (N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone) and NEP (N-ethyl-2-pyrrolidone) often found in traditional cookware. In addition to being completely free of PFOA, APEO, NMP and NEP, the Stone Earth Pan is also far more durable and scratch-resistant than other non-stick surfaces. With better non-stick properties, the Stone Earth Pan allows you to saute, fry, bake, boil and braise with as little as half the amount of oil normally used, and cleaning is a breeze. The Stone Earth Pan by Ozeri is made of the highest quality die-cast aluminum that allows for even cooking and fantastic browning without hot spots. It boasts a magnetized bottom for rapid heat transfer on induction stoves, and a heat resistant silicone coated handle. Your satisfaction is guaranteed.

This unique waffle maker creates a large hexagon shaped waffle which has a unique bubbled texture. These delicious waffles, sometimes called egg waffles or eggettes have crispy golden outsides and light, tender interiors. An eggette is a kind of spherical pancake or ball waffle popular in Hong Kong and Macao. The food item is also referred to as an egg puff, egg waffle, bubble waffle or by its Cantonese name, gai daan and is made from eggs, sugar, flour, and light evaporated milk. They are best served hot, and often eaten plain. They can also be served with fruit and flavors such as strawberry, coconut or chocolate.They are sometimes referred to as \"Hong Kong cakes\" in Chinatowns across America, especially in New York. Eggettes are one of the most popular Hong Kong \"street snacks\" and they have been a favoured street snack in HK since their emergence in 1950s and were made with coal fire heating, sold from street kiosks in Hong Kong in the early days. They are made from a sweet batter that is cooked on a hot griddle, a special frying pan with small round \"wells\" (resembling a \u00c6bleskiver but with smaller and more of the round \"wells\") and with them set on hot coals in the fire or more commonly, on an electrical heat generator. The egg batter is poured over the special frying pan and heated; the small ovals of eggettes are thus formed. In addition to the conventional \"egg taste\", they are also available in a variety of flavours such as chocolate, green-tea and ginger, etc. Most pancakes are quick breads, although some are also made using a yeast-raised or fermented batter.

Will fit the following Berkey systems: Travel Berkey, Big Berkey, Royal Berkey, Imperial Berkey, Crown Berkey, Berkey Light. Black Berkey Purification Elements are more powerful than any other gravity filter element currently available. In fact, we tested the Black Berkey purification elements with more than 10,000 times the concentration of pathogens per liter than is required by standard test protocol. This concentration of pathogens is so great that the post filtered water should be expected to contain 100,000 or more pathogens per liter (99.99% reduction - the requirement for pathogenic removal). Incredibly the purification elements removed 100%. Absolutely no pathogens were cultured from the effluent or were able to be detected, even under an electron microscope, setting a new standard in water purification. Black Berkey purification elements are so powerful, they can remove red food coloring from water without removing the beneficial minerals your body needs. Virtually no other filtration element can duplicate this performance. The powerful Black Berkey purification elements also remove or reduce viruses, pathogenic cysts, parasites, harmful or unwanted chemicals such as herbicides and pesticides, VOCs, detergents, organic solvents, trihalomethanes, cloudiness, silt, sediment, nitrates, nitrites, heavy metals, foul tastes and odors, yet they leave in the healthful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.", "salesrank_2018": "2424"}, "B00BWIWYBW": {"description": "The PF-2 is for use with Black Berkey Purifiers - If you use ceramic filters, you will need the PF-4 *** PF-2 reduction elements are designed for use in conjunction with Black Berkey water purification elements to adsorb the following unwanted elements found in drinking water.

FLUORIDE: Testing for fluoride was based on 20-30ppm of the ion in the influent aqueous solution at a flow rate of no more than 3 gpm per cubic foot of media. Results of < 1ppm of the fluoride ion in the effluent were typical for the media (95% reduction). Under optimum conditions, effluent concentrations of less than 50 ppb were readily achieved (99.75% reduction).

At the core of the sub-micron ceramic filter is the most basic of elements: Diatomaceous Earth. This is the same substance, which artisans refine into exquisite porcelain and pottery. The microscopic pores of the ceramic filter element make it an extremely efficient filter for the reduction of particulate matter, pathogenic bacteria and fine sediment from water. Minute particulate matter will quickly plug media style filters, but the ceramics have the added benefit of being re-cleanable and re-useable. The Super Sterasyl element, used in Berkey systems, utilizes the latest technological advances of ceramic filtration by incorporating pure silver impregnation into the porous ceramic shell to inhibit the growth of bacteria. Furthermore, the Super Sterasyl ceramic filter elements contain activated carbon, which reduces unwanted chemical and organic compounds from the water while also improving taste. Each filter can be cleaned many, many times before needing replacement. If using tap water, the filters will normally only need to be cleaned every 6 months. You will know when your filters need to be cleaned because the filtration rate will slow down. To clean, simply rub the filters with a scotch-brite pad under running water (as in the picture above).

The theory behind this innovation is simple. The bottle's filter is designed to remove and/or dramatically reduce a vast array of health-threatening contaminants from questionable sources of water, including remote lakes and streams, stagnant ponds and water supplies in foreign countries where regulations may be sub-standard at best. This advanced technology was developed, refined and proven through diligent, investigative research and testing performed by water purification specialists, researchers and engineers. The media within the filter element removes contaminants by a surface phenomenon known as \"adsorption\" which results from the molecular attraction of substances to the surface of the media. As the bottle is pressed, the source water is forced through the filter. The quality and volume of media used, determine the rate of adsorption. The flow rate or time of exposure through the filter has been calculated to yield the greatest volume removal of toxic chemicals caused by pollution from industry and agriculture. This exclusive filter element is impregnated with proprietary \"absorbing\" media that promotes IONIC \"absorption\" of pollutants within the micro-porous element, such as aluminum, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, mercury and other dangerous heavy metals. The \"Tortuous Path\" structure of these pores gives it its unique characteristics.

They're available in multiple size ranges and colors making up almost 200 options! Whether the sheets are a gift for a friend or you are buying for yourself, you know you are getting top-quality luxury with Exceptional Sheets. Why is Egyptian cotton so much better for your sheets? Quite simply, Egyptian cotton produces longer fibers (up to twice as long as a standard cotton fiber). The longer fibers or staples are easily spun into finer count yarns, and turned into the softest sheets you will ever sleep on. It's that simple! \"Ply\" refers to the number of yarns wrapped together in a single thread. The process of plying creates thicker threads, which will impact a sheet's feel and durability. Finer threads allow for higher thread counts resulting in a softer sheet with an elegant drape. Our Single ply sheets use individual, un-plied threads in the weaving process, resulting in lighter-weight fabric with exceptional drape and softness.

Season the garlic butter well with lots of pepper but just a little salt as the anchovy or bacon will act as a seasoning too. Cut each potato into 8 slices. Coat the slices of each potato with the butter mix then reassemble each potato on a piece of double-thick foil. Cut the anchovies or bacon into strips and put between the slices.

Featuring Dyson Radial Root Cyclone technology with remodeled airflows to maximize suction power, it captures more dirt and microscopic dust than any other, with no loss of suction. Cleaner head self-adjusts for optimal contact- even on hard floors. No awkward dials.   With new Ball technology, the DC40 houses more components inside the ball, reducing clutter around it \u2013 steers right up to edges and into difficult places. Weighing only 14.5 lbs, it\u2019s lightweight and durable, engineered materials are selected for their strengths and durability. Instant release wand stretches up to 5 times in length for stairs and hard to reach places. Motorized brush bar is powered by an independent motor for better cleaning performance and has fingertip controls to instantly turn the motorized brush bar off for hard floors, delicate floors and rugs.  Washable lifetime filter captures allergens and microscopic particles such as pollen, mold and bacteria and expels cleaner air. Clear bin is made from tough polycarbonate, letting you see when it\u2019s full and empties at the push of a button. No need to buy replacement bags, belts and filters means no extra costs and less impact on the environment.  DC40 Multi Floor comes with a combination tool that has soft bristles for gentle dusting and a stair tool for removing dirt and dust from corners and vertical edges of stairs. DC40 also includes a 6 month warranty, parts and labor guaranteed by Dyson.   Patented Dyson Technology Dyson engineers are constantly testing and inventing, trying to find new ways to make their technology better. As they work, they file patent applications to protect their inventions from copycat manufacturers. That\u2019s why the only place you\u2019ll find Dyson technology is inside a Dyson machine.  New Radial Root Cyclone technology Ordinary vacuum cleaners rely on bags to trap dust and dirt. As you use them, the tiny holes in the bag clog up with particles of dust. This restricts the flow of air, so the vacuum cleaner loses suction. Dyson vacuum cleaners don\u2019t rely on bags to trap dust and dirt. They use cyclone technology, which spins the air at incredibly high speeds. The cyclones inside a Dyson vacuum cleaner generate centrifugal forces many thousands of times the force of gravity. Dust, dirt and pet hair are flung out of the airflow and straight into the bin. No bag. No loss of suction.  Dyson has been continually refining cyclone technology since inventing it more than 20 years ago. DC40 Multi floor has new Radial Root Cyclone technology. Reconfigured air channels and improved flow efficiency reduce turbulence and preserve air pressure, so that the inner cyclones can extract more microscopic particles. These refinements help remove more dirt, dust, allergens and pet hair for the airflow.  Ball technology to help you steer with ease Dyson Ball upright vacuum cleaners use patented Ball technology to overcome the steering limitations of fixed wheels. They ride on a ball, which turns on the spot so you can steer with ease, changing direction with just a turn of the wrist.  The ball itself is made of glass-reinforced polypropylene- the same material used in the manufacture of car dashboards. It combines high impact strength with the resistance to distortion. The ball also holds the heaviest component, (the motor), positioned towards the base for a lower center of gravity and greater stability.  About Dyson Refurbished Vacuums  Fully Restored and Functional Dyson refurbished vacuums have been stripped down, cleaned out, reassembled and thoroughly tested. They\u2019re restored to a fully functional condition. In short, they are everything a Dyson machine should be- they work properly and don\u2019t lose suction. Dyson refurbishes vacuums that are returned to us by retailers or consumers.  Refurbishing these machines, rather than disposing of them, means that the parts and materials are re-used instead of wasted.    Refurbishing the VacuumWhen a machine comes to us to be refurbished, it is first stripped down as far as necessary. Components removed from the machine that meet our high standards of quality are kept and cleaned. Most damaged or broken components are sent away for recycling. The core of the machine is thoroughly cleaned and new parts are added to replace damaged or cosmetically unacceptable parts discovered during the stripping down process.   Just like our brand new machines, the rebuilt machine then undergoes a comprehensive series of electrical and performance tests to ensure that it works as it should. For our vacuums, one of the tests carried out is a suction test. All refurbished vacuums are electrically tested in compliance with electrical and safety requirements.    6 Month Parts and Labor Warranty One of the primary differences between a new Dyson machine and a refurbished Dyson machine is its appearance\u2013 a scratch here or there or a slightly clouded bin may provide a clue that it has been previously used. After it has passed all of the tests, the machine is then packaged and sent out.  All Dyson refurbished vacuums come with a 6 month parts and labor warranty.

This juicer uses cold-press technology to thoroughly juice all kinds of fruits, nuts, and veggies and separate out the pulp, so you'll enjoy more juice and less foam. Juice from the NutriPro also stays fresher longer, so you can keep it on hand for an energy-boosting pick-me-up. The NutriPro includes two BPA-free 50-ounce plastic jars: one to catch and store juice and the other for pulp.  Cold Press JuicerAt a Glance:  Cold-press technology for more juice and nutrients Eliminates oxidization for juice that stays fresh for up to 72 hours Quiet, efficient induction motor Removable parts are dishwasher safe (top rack only) Experiment with different combinations and green juices   Cold press technology delivers more juice and more nutrition.    The more thorough juicing process preserves more healthy nutrients and enzymes. Click to view larger.  Cold-Press Technology for More Nutrient-Rich Juice Conventional juicers have fast spinning blades that cut fruits and vegetables to produce juice. The NutriPro uses single-auger, cold-press technology with a single juicing screw that crushes fruit and vegetables before compressing and squeezing the juice. This no-blade process produces more juice while wasting less pulp, which helps preserve nutrients and enzymes Quiet, Efficient Induction Motor Prevents Oxidation NutriPro's induction motor reduces friction and maintains a lower temperature throughout the juicing process. This prevents oxidation, which helps to eliminate foaming and deliver better-tasting juice that stays fresh for up to 72 hours. The motor is also quiet, with an operating noise of approximately 60 decibels compared to the 95 decibels conventional-bladed juicers typically generate. This lower level of sound makes it easier to use in noise-sensitive environments, such as offices.  Easy Operation and Cleanup The juicer's jam-resistant operation and reverse button allow for fast, continuous juicing--just add water and give your juicer a rinse between different fruits and vegetables. When it's time to clean up, all of the juicer's removable plastic parts are dishwasher safe (top rack only).  Juice All Kinds of Fruits and Veggies NutriPro makes it easy to experiment with delicious, healthy combinations of fruits, nuts, and veggies. Impress your brunch guests with juices made from citrus fruits, leafy greens, peaches, wheatgrass, sprouts, and more. Even high-starch fruits that don't typically produce juice can be skinned, pitted, frozen, and fed into the NutriPro juicer to produce a velvety dairy-free sorbet.

It is not necessary to remove seeds or stems. Add a handful of apple chunks to the hopper. Bunch spinach, parsley, and wheatgrass into a small, tight ball and feed into the hopper.

The verdict? Fresh beans are always preferable.   Included dual wall filters provide excellent practice for budding baristas   Included single wall filters provide a more challenging experience for those who have already mastered the art of espresso   Convenient hidden storage compartment for the filters and included cleaning kit.   Hands-free filling for the portafilter directly from the integrated burr grinder Fresh is Best In the world of coffee, freshness can be measured in seconds. By the time even five minutes has passed, ground beans have started to lose their flavor. Grinding beans every time you want fresh espresso takes time, though, and oftentimes it becomes a tradeoff between taste and convenience. The Breville Barista Express solves this problem, delivering fresh, quality espresso at remarkable speed, thanks to its integrated burr grinder. Go from beans to espresso in under a minute\u2014all in the comfort of your own home. Caf\u00e9 quality espresso in your home Espresso making is notorious for being both an art and a science, requiring you to carefully adjust each of the inputs (grind size, grind amount, etc.). But even complete beginners and aspiring baristas can pull a perfect shot from the Breville Barista Express. For beginners, it comes with two dual-wall, pressurized filters that regulate pressure and help optimize the extraction. For more experienced baristas, the Barista Express includes two single-wall, non-pressurized filters that give you more room to experiment with different grind sizes, grind amounts, and tamping pressure. As either a crash-course or a continuation study, the Barista Express gives you free rein to explore the art of espresso. In addition to its integrated burr grinder, the Breville Barista Express has an Italian-manufactured 15 bar pump and thermocoil heating system that ensures accurate regulation of water temperature for a full-flavored espresso. A pre-brew function and flat shower head make sure that the water is optimally distributed through the coffee puck. The Barista Express also has several helpful features, such as a cup warmer on the top of the machine and a feature that removes excess water from the filter basket after coffee extraction, so the used grounds form a dry puck for quicker cleanup. Lastly, it has a stainless steel 360 degree swivel-action steam wand for lattes and cappuccinos. For beginners and aspiring baristas alike, the Barista Express makes good espresso accessible and easy to make. Designed with the consumer in mind The Breville Barista Express is built from high-quality materials so the resulting machine is as sturdy as possible. No-slip feet keep the machine from sliding across the counter when the burr grinder is activated. The Barista Express is housed in a sleek stainless steel casing, making it an attractive and timeless addition to any kitchen. The entire unit is easy to clean and comes with a hideaway storage compartment for the included cleaning tools, in addition to an easily removable drip tray.    Click on image to view larger Product Features   Integrated conical burr grinder and half-pound bean hopper: stainless steel conical burrs optimize extraction of flavor from the bean by maximizing the surface area of the grinds. Use freshly ground beans for every shot for more full espresso flavor. Hopper has locking system for easy removal, storage and transfer of coffee beans. Grind size and grind amount selector dials: choose among grind settings from fine to coarse and adjust the amount of freshly ground espresso dosed into the filter basket. Filter size button: indicate whether you are using a single- or double-wall filter basket and the grinder will dispense the required amount of ground coffee for the appropriate filter type. 54mm tamper: for expert tamping control.

Unfortunately, this method doesn't work. The reason is that there is not enough surface area at the top of the bottle to allow sufficient amounts of air to make contact with the wine.\nTo extract the best qualities from your red wine, it must be allowed to breathe or aerate before service. For many years sommeliers and vineyards have used wine aerating devices because they understand the benefits of wine aeration and decanting. Wine aeration releases the aromatic properties of wine by letting it breathe by exposing or infusing the wine with oxygen.\nNow you can ensure that your wine tastes and smells as the winemakers originally intended by using the Vinoulli wine aerator.\nThe Vinoulli Wine Aerator comes complete with:\n- Unique patented wine aerator- Sediment filter screen- Storage bag- Display base- Instruction leaflet- Luxury gift box\nThe unique design of the Vinoulli wine aerator instantly releases the bouquet and flavors of your wine without the delay of traditional decanting, by simply pouring the wine through the aerator into a glass.\nRecently, the largest producer of wines in Latin America - Concha y Toro - purchased 10,000 of these wine aerators for its clients to enjoy their wines at their best.

Too much humidity is just as bad as being too dry, especially when mold enters the picture. Boveda\u2019s patented technology adds or removes humidity as conditions require, maintaining the specific moisture content engineered into each pack. Available in three sizes and a range of RH levels, there\u2019s a Boveda for every package, container, and personal taste. What Humidity Level Do I Need? Boveda is available in relative humidity levels of 62, 65, 69, 72, 75, and 84% (exclusively for seasoning). All Boveda are accurate to +/- 1% of the RH printed on the pack in an air-tight environment. Humidors are not air tight. Depending on humidor quality and ambient conditions, it\u2019s not uncommon for the actual RH to be stable anywhere from 2-6 points below the Boveda RH you\u2019ve chosen. This is why we recommend 72% for your first set after seasoning. If it\u2019s 72 on the nose, you\u2019re perfect. If it drops a few points, you\u2019re still perfect. Based on how your humidor performs, you can decide whether to move to 62, 65, 69, or 75. How Do I Know When Boveda Needs To Be Replaced? All Boveda will turn into a solid wafer when they\u2019re dead. So it\u2019s short of that, when there aren\u2019t many soft spots left, that you\u2019ll want to replace them. Pronounced crystallization and hardening of the corners first is completely normal. What Makes Boveda Different? All humidification products are not created equal, and we know it\u2019s difficult to cut through all of the misinformation out there. Below are some simple points which we believe will help consumers (and retailers) understand the important differences between the various types of humidification on the market. If you think your humidification device is \"regulating\" to a certain RH level because the packaging says so, it's very simple to test. Place the (filled) device in a clear air-tight container with a hygrometer and let it sit for 24 hours. Only Boveda will still be reading at the RH level it's supposed to, because it's the only true two-way humidity control.   How Many Boveda Do I Need?   Humidor Capacity Wood  Plastic   0-50 2+ 1   50-100 2-4+ 1   100-150 4-6+ 2   150-200 6-8+ 2   200-250 8-10+ 2-3     How Do I Choose The Right Number Of Boveda? We recommend using at least one large 60 gram Boveda per 25 cigars your humidor holds, even if it isn\u2019t full. It\u2019s still air space and wood that needs proper humidification.Because Boveda will never over-humidify beyond the number on the pack, using more than is recommended will just work more efficiently and need to be replaced less often.Air-tight containers like plastic tupperdors and travel humidors don't need as much horsepower to keep humidified because they don't leak as much air.   The Boveda Isn't Reaching The Number On The Pack - What's Wrong? This is a common question and the solution always boils down to one (or more) of these three issues: You didn't season your humidor or it needs to be re-seasoned because it's winter or you live in a very dry climate. Your hygrometer needs to be calibrated.  You're not using enough or the right size Boveda. Note: Do not mix Boveda RH levels within the same humidor, and do not use Boveda in the same humidor with other humidification products. They will fight against each other and reduce the efficiency of the Boveda.

One side is designed for cutting and the other side is designed for serving. Serving side has a beautiful laser-etched varieties of beer word design.

Overall, board measures 15 x 8.5 x 5/8-Inch. In 2002 Totally Bamboo company owners, Tom & Joanne Sullivan, designed and introduced the world's first bamboo cutting board. Their search for a lightweight, ecologically viable material to replace oak in the manufacturing of \"Hollywood Chairs\", their luxury customized director's chairs they manufacture and supply to the movie and theater industries, introduced them to bamboo. They experimented with bamboo, long known for its strength versus weight ratio and the resulting chair was much lighter and also stronger than the oak they had been using. Intrigued with using such a renewable and sustainable material, they set out to design products using their \"engineered bamboo\" and in doing so, developed the world's first bamboo cutting board. Bamboo, they discovered, is harder than maple, making it perfect for a cutting surface. Not only is bamboo hard and lightweight, is it one of the fastest growing, sustainable materials on the planet. Bamboo is a grass that produces more oxygen than a hardwood forest of comparable size. For their products, Totally Bamboo uses only Moso bamboo, which is harvested after the bamboo has grown for at least 5 years - this ensures the fibers are mature, which adds to its strength and density. The Moso bamboo has an extensive root system that continually sends up new shoots, naturally replenishing itself and therefore it does not require replanting, making it one of the most renewable resources known.", "salesrank_2018": "522228"}, "B00CWAE89A": {"description": "The Oster FPST2574CRBW hand mixer offers a powerful 225-watt motor for mixing efficiency. 6 speeds and chrome beaters provide versatility to mix everything from cookies to mashed potatoes.

Its Smart Sensor technology automatically detects and avoids stairs, and doesn\u2019t bump into furniture like other robots do. It returns to the charge base and resumes where it left off! No other robot is this smart.     Great for picking up dust and allergens         Neato Robotics XV Signature Robotic Vacuum - A Smart, Powerful Robot Vacuum   The technology is a revolutionary system developed by Neato Robotics that combines laser vision with mapping. The robot uses a laser and sensors to see its surroundings and create accurate maps of areas to be cleaned \u2013 including furniture, objects and doorways. The robot constantly updates its map of the room, so if a new object is added into the room during a cleaning run, the robot will add it to the map.   Square and Proud   Neato\u2019s unique square front and low profile design keeps it close to corners and walls for maximum pick-up of dirt, dust, debris, and pet hair \u2013 all without sacrificing suction power! It automatically moves from one floor type to another, and even manages rugs with fringe. The Neato XV Signature comes with a high performance filter which makes it a great choice for anyone with allergies or who is concerned about dust.   How to's on your newly purchased Neato Robotic Vacuum   Place your robot vacuum on the charge base for its initial charge. Neato is ready to clean when the status light turns solid green. Charge the batteries overnight before you use your Neato Robotic Vacuum for the first time. Note: Do this even if you have a solid green light after a short charging window. After an overnight charge, run through three complete cycles of charging and cleaning until recharge. This will help to get the most capacity from your batteries.           Built-In Smarts   Unlike other robot vacuums that bump around, Neato XV uses patented laser-guided technology to scan and map the room, plans the most efficient course - and vacuums your house in record time.    Advanced Laser Guided Navigation and Smart Sensor Technology    Scans and systematically cleans your home.  Knows where it\u2019s been and where it\u2019s going.  Automatically moves from room to room, chooses the best path, and gets in corners and under furniture.  Control Center - Easily schedule daily cleanings, or just push a button for spot clean or instant multi-room cleaning!  Software Upgrades - Robot software can be upgraded when new features become available.  High-Performance Filters - The best choice for reducing dust and allergens.  Blade Brush - Works on all floor types.  Bagless Dirt Bin - A large, bagless dirt bin makes it easy to use and easy to empty.      Getting The Most From Your Neato Robotic Vacuum:  You can recalibrate your Neato robot\u2019s batteries to improve capacity and lengthen runtime between charges. You may need to recalibrate the batteries in these situations:  a)The robot is new, b)The batteries are new, c)You updated the software, or d)Your cleaning area expanded. Follow the steps below to recalibrate the battery:  Turn off any scheduled cleaning and confirm the robot's ON/OFF switch is on. Reset the batteries by going to Menu->Support->New Batteries. Place the Neato robot on its charge base over night to ensure a full charge. Run the robot until it finishes cleaning the maximum area you ever want it to clean (i.e. the entire house), or until the robot displays \u201cBattery Low\u201d on its display and needs to recharge. Dock the robot on its charge base for a full charge, until the status light turns solid green. Run the robot as usual until it needs to recharge again. If the runtime improves to longer than 40 minutes, the batteries have been recalibrated. If the run-time is still less than 40 minutes, go through the recharging cycle again.   Battery Error Code: If you receive a battery 0002, 0003, 0008 or 0009 notification, this means your robot is either in the off position or the batteries have a loose connection. Check the switch inside the dust bin and place in the down position which activates the battery connection. If that does not resolve the issue, open the battery compartment and verify the battery connection is secure. If needed, instructions can be found on Neato support site. My Neato Robot Got Stuck: Firstly, Neato usually knows how to get out of a bind. Once the robot realizes it is caught, it will work to free itself.  Sometimes bed mattresses or couches sag underneath. If the robot goes under sagging furniture, it could get stuck or \u201cblinded. \u201d To fix this, put a box in the center under your bed or couch, or raise the bed or couch a couple inches higher to give the robot the 4\u201d clearance it needs. You can also lay down the boundary marker to prevent robot getting under the furniture.  For further queries please contact Neato Robotics' Customer Care @ 1-877-296-3286.

Braava uses disposable or microfiber cleaning cloths to pick up dirt, hair and dust from all your hardsurface floors including tile, vinyl, hardwood and laminate. Just attach a cloth, set Braava down, press a button and off it goes, using advanced robotic technology to track where it's been and where it needs to go. It's whisper-quiet too, so you can go about your daily activities without disruption. The included Turbo Charge Cradle is a convenient, one-stop charging and storage space, charging Braava 380t in as fast as two hours. Braava uses either disposable cleaning cloths, including Swiffer brand, or reusable microfiber cloths to remove dirt, dust and hair from your floors so you don't have to. Braava has two cleaning modes to choose from depending on the job you need done. In sweep mode, Braava dry mops your floors moving in straight lines using dry cleaning cloths. In mop mode, Braava uses a special back-and-forth mopping action and damp cleaning cloths to lift surface dirt and grime off your floors. With the Pro-Clean System included in Braava 380t, a special Reservoir Cleaning Pad dispenses liquid throughout the cleaning cycle to keep the cloth damp. Cleaning cloths are easy to attach and remove with Braava's removable magnetic multi-purpose cleaning pad. The NorthStar Navigation System 2 works like an indoor GPS that helps Braava keep track of where it has been and where it needs to go. The NorthStar Navigation Cube projects a signal that Braava uses to determine its location. Additional NorthStar Navigation Cubes can be purchased for the Braava 380t to expand the robot's dry mopping capabilities for bigger homes. As Braava cleans, it builds a map of the area, mapping walls, obstacles and drop-offs as it encounters them.", "salesrank_2018": "3433"}, "B00DCDYKQW": {"description": "The True D\u00e9cor all-in-one wine bottle Sealer & and build in vacuum preserver Pump, Will remove virtually all the air from the bottle, Operation is incredibly simple - just insert the stopper and push it down as far as it goes tightly inside the bottle, and pull the top lever up and down, to pump the air out until you feel some resistance, and Done!

Having a Snug for each of your utensils makes them have their own \"notch\" for clipping onto any cookware (even with a lip) while cooking, thereby eliminating the need for a spoon rest. The Snug is made of FDA grade, high temperature resistant Silicone material (heat resistant up to 570\u00b0F or 300\u00b0C) so your metal spatulas stay cool, the wooden ones don't burn and the plastic ones never melt. The Snug comes in 2 sizes - small one for utensils with thinner, narrower handles and large one for thicker, round handles. The Snug is the only such gadget out there in the market that can proudly claim to have no nooks and crannies or metal spring clips so that it stays free of harmful bacteria and can be washed by hand simply by putting it under running water. It is even 100% dishwasher safe if you choose to thrown it in. No metal on the Snug also means no rust and no fear of scratching your expensive cookware.

BISSELL Vacuum FAQ What is multi-cyclonic technology? This technology uses airflow to create centrifugal force that separates fine particles from larger debris before it enters the dirt cup. Because of this separation, more dirt stays inside the tank and has less opportunity to \u201cescape\u201d through the rest of the vacuum system. Vacuum filters then trap microscopic dust and allergens to help keep the air in your home free from more allergens.    What is the benefit of Lift-Off Technology? With Lift-Off Technology, you not only get the powerful clean of a full-size upright vacuum, but also the convenient cleaning of an easy-release portable vacuum. Take cleaning where you need it\u2014easily.    What are the advantages of a bagless vacuum? You\u2019ll save on the expense of replacement bags and the need to keep them on hand. Bagless vacuums have clear dirt cups, which allow you to see the dirt and debris that have been collected so you know when to empty it. It is also easy to remove objects you might accidentally vacuum up.    How often should I change my vacuum's filters? Many vacuums have filters that need to be cleaned and/or replaced on a regular basis to keep the vacuum running well. It is recommended to check your filters monthly and change every 3\u20136 months depending on use. Check your vacuum\u2019s user guide for information on your specific model.

The machine\u2019s cleaner head has an active base place, which self-adjusts automatically for optimal contact with all floor types. On hard floors the base plate lowers to create an efficient seal, and the brush bar lifts clear off the floor to protect delicate surfaces. On carpet, the base plate rises and the brush bar lowers for optimum bristle penetration- removing ground-in dirt and pet hair from different depths of carpet pile. And because the cleaner head adjusts automatically, there are no awkward dials and you don\u2019t need to bend down to make adjustments.  Dyson cyclones capture more dirt than any other cyclone. DC40 Origin has Radial Root Cyclone technology with remodeled airflows to maximize suction power. DC40 Multi floor also has patented Ball technology. It turns on the spot, which allows you to maneuver more easily around obstacles and into awkward spaces. And because the motor and other key components are located inside the ball, the machine has a lower center of gravity- making it even easier to steer.  Patented Dyson Technology Dyson engineers are constantly testing and inventing, trying to find new ways to make their technology better. As they work, they file patent applications to protect their inventions from copycat manufacturers. That\u2019s why the only place you\u2019ll find Dyson technology is inside a Dyson machine.  Radial Root Cyclone technology: Ordinary vacuum cleaners rely on bags to trap dust and dirt. As you use them, the tiny holes in the bag clog up with particles of dust. This restricts the flow of air, so the vacuum cleaner loses suction. Dyson vacuum cleaners don\u2019t rely on bags to trap dust and dirt. They use cyclone technology, which spins the air at incredibly high speeds. The cyclones inside a Dyson vacuum cleaner generate centrifugal forces many thousands of times the force of gravity. Dust, dirt and pet hair are flung out of the airflow and straight into the bin. No bag. No loss of suction. Dyson has been continually refining cyclone technology since inventing it more than 20 years ago. DC40 Origin has Radial Root Cyclone technology. Reconfigured air channels and improved flow efficiency reduce turbulence and preserve air pressure, so that the inner cyclones can extract more microscopic particles. These refinements help remove more dirt, dust, allergens and pet hair for the airflow.  Ball technology to help you steer with ease: Dyson Ball upright vacuum cleaners use patented Ball technology to overcome the steering limitations of fixed wheels. They ride on a ball, which turns on the spot so you can steer with ease, changing direction with just a turn of the wrist. The ball itself is made of glass-reinforced polypropylene- the same material used in the manufacture of car dashboards. It combines high impact strength with the resistance to distortion. The ball also holds the heaviest component, (the motor), positioned towards the base for a lower center of gravity and greater stability.  Features Self-adjusting cleaner head:  Many upright vacuum cleaners use fixed settings and their cleaner heads don\u2019t self-adjust to different floor types. And the bigger the gap between the cleaner head and floor, the more suction power is wasted. DC40 Origin has an active base plate. It creates the optimal cleaner head contact for every floor type, reducing air leaks and retaining suction power on all floor types- wood, carpet, vinyl and tile.  Instant release wand: DC40 Origin has an instant release, long reach wand for cleaning stairs and awkward areas- it stretches up to 5 times in length. There are no separate parts to assemble.  Extra tools: DC40 Origin comes with a Combination tool and a Stair tool. The Combination tool has a debris nozzle that converts to a brush tool for dusting. The Stair tool removes dirt and dust from corners and against vertical edges of stairs.  Captures allergens, expels cleaner air: The Dyson DC40 Origin has HEPA filtration and a lifetime washable filter. Dyson cyclones capture microscopic particles down to 0.5 microns in size, including pollen, mold and bacteria. Hygienic bin emptying with push button release:  The bin on a Dyson vacuum cleaner is transparent so you can see when it needs emptying- and just how much dust, dirt and pet hair your new Dyson machine has picked up. No extra costs:  Other vacuum cleaners are still designed to need replacement bags and filters- and the cost soon adds up. Dyson vacuums don\u2019t have bags and have lifetime washable filters, so there are no extra costs to worry about. 5 year parts and labor warranty:  Your Dyson vacuum cleaner is likely to take a few knocks and bashes during everyday use- but that\u2019s nothing compared to what Dyson puts its machines through during testing and development. All Dyson vacuum cleaners undergo a lengthy and rigorous testing program. That\u2019s why DC40 Origin comes with a 5 year warranty- parts and labor guaranteed by Dyson.

They're ideal for whiskey, sangria, iced tea or any cold drink where flavor balance is essential. \n\nEasy to Fill, Easy to Empty\n To fill the mold, pour water in through the top holes. The silicone is sturdy yet flexible, so when the ice balls are ready to remove, you just pop them right out. \n\nDurable, BPA Free Silicone\n Use this mold with the peace of mind that comes from knowing there's none of the health risk associated with plastics that leach BPA into foods they contain. Plus, it's easy to clean and can even go in the dishwasher. \n\n2 Year Warranty\n Quality materials and construction ensure years of carefree use, helping you entertain guests at all sorts of get-togethers from children's parties to sophisticated cocktail soirees.

Some accounts trace the Guild's birth to Athens in the latter half of the 4th century BCE. Allegedly, several lesser philosophers grew weary of the endless Socratic dialogue endemic in their trade and turned to crafting household implements and playthings. (Hence the assertions that Socrates quaffed his hemlock poison from a Guild-designed chalice, though vigorous debate surrounds the question of whether it was a \"disappearing\" chalice.) Others argue that the UPG dates from the High Middle Ages, when the Philosophers Guild entered the world of commerce by selling bawdy pamphlets to pilgrims facing long lines for the restroom. Business boomed until 1211 when Pope Innocent III condemned the publications. Not surprisingly, this led to increased sales, even as half our membership was burned at the stake. More recently, revisionist historians have pinpointed the birth of the Guild to the time it was still cool to live in New York City's Lower East Side. Two brothers turned their inner creativity and love of paying rent towards fulfilling the people's needs for finger puppets, warm slippers, coffee cups, and cracking up at stuff.", "salesrank_2018": "132187"}, "B00DWFWI78": {"description": "Enjoy a Experience of a true luxury and a cool comfortable night''s sleep with exceptionally thin breathable Sheet set that have a silky soft feel and a lustrous finish.

Go about your day - Simply plug in the HotLogic Mini and enjoy your daily activities knowing that your HotLogic Mini is safely warming your meal. Eat and enjoy - This is the best part. You deserve to enjoy a wonderful hot meal.The HotLogic Mini makes sure it's cooked to perfection and ready when you are. As with most first-of-its-kind products, HotLogic is not the easiest to explain to someone who hasn't used it before. Imagine trying to explain what a vacuum cleaner to someone who lived in the 1850s or explaining a microwave to your great grandmother when she was a girl. A \"slow cooking oven\" is an accurate description of HotLogic, and one we use sometimes when we're using it more like an oven. The truth is that this isn't 100% accurate simply because it's not broad enough. HotLogic can also be used to reheat food perfectly without overcooking it, so it's kind of like a microwave\u2026kind of. When you're cooking slow roasts, baked potatoes or the sort, you can use it like a crock pot (that knows when to turn off and stop cooking things to mush). HotLogic may be like all these things, but it still doesn't come close to being in the same category with any of them.   Why doesn't HotLogic fit into any of these categories? Because of one simple reason: Unlike all these other appliances, HotLogic is timeless. Not in the classic design sense, but quite literally: HotLogic removes any and all time constraints to your meal times. Once it's done, it's ready \u2013 right then, or 12 hours from then. The amount of time you wait to eat it won't make your meal overcooked, or mushy, or with crispy edges. It doesn't matter whether you're cooking uncooked, frozen chicken breasts with fresh beans on top or reheating last night's pizza: HotLogic knows when you're meal is cooked, and when it is, it holds it at a save, delicious temperature until you're ready to eat it. THIS is what makes HotLogic so difficult to describe. It does something that literally NOTHING else can do! It frees you from checking the crock pot, sticking around the house because the oven is on, and relying on the microwave's always-inconsistent reheating. All it takes is the tiniest shift in how you go about your day. Planning just 12 hours ahead can make the difference between breakfast that's hot and ready for you when you wake up and dinner that's ready for you when you get home from work, and a day dictated by meal prep times. Save money \u2013 hot meals without the expense of eating out Eat healthy \u2013 home cooked meals so you know what's in it Convenient \u2013 plug it in and it cooks while you work or play Super Efficient \u2013 costs less than a penny per meal Easy \u2013 no programs or buttons to push, use almost any type of flat bottom, sealed container ", "salesrank_2018": "4681"}, "B00ECIX4HW": {"description": "Accurate Kitchen Scale, Food Scale, Digital Kitchen Scale, Large Display, Easy to Clean: Weighing food is no longer a boring chore.

It was promptly hailed as one of the year's best new products and selected for inclusion in highly prestigious Smithsonian's Permanent Design Collection. Stressing design, function and quality, Cleret squeegees have become the standard by which ALL others are measured. The Cleret IDO 2 shower squeegee is simply the result of what consumers have told Cleret they wanted in a squeegee... functionality, ease of use, stylish, quality, and most important, LIGHT WEIGHT. Heavy squeegees if dropped can injury a foot or damage a shower floor. The DO 2 features dual wiping blades to get every drop on the first swipe. Unlike most squeegees, which are only effective on flat surfaces, the iDO 2's super flexible wiping blades work well on contoured surfaces as well. Used after bathing, it's the perfect tool to help prevent unsightly and unsanitary waterspotting in the bath. Use need not be limited to the bath, use it to clean any glass surface, i.e. windows, patio doors, etc. PLEASE NOTE: When opening the package the wall hanger is cleverly \"wrapped\" around the squeegee handle and it can be easy to miss.

According to the EPA, once ingested PFOA is capable of remaining in people for a very long time, and has been shown to cause developmental and other adverse effects in laboratory animals.

This is because the Stainless Steel Earth Pan utilizes a completely safe and environmentally-friendly coating developed in the USA.
