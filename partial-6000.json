Safety and practicality were the guiding principles during the development process, and our little Kettle came complete with an innovative steam shield.  Through user feedback, we realized we missed a key consumer insight - that a Tea Kettle, while a practical kitchen tool, is often a centerpiece in the kitchen. Users would leave them out on the stovetop when not in use and some even coordinated their entire kitchen decor around their Kettles. While the steam shield was innovative, it was considered by many to be unsightly.  In 1998, we corrected the aesthetic flaws to our otherwise safe, practical and well-performing Kettle with the Uplift. The kicker is that all of its elegant aesthetics came as a direct result of making the Uplift safe and easy to use. Problems Identified  Handles on tea kettles are positioned too close to the steam and hot water at the spout, making it uncomfortable while pouring Angle of kettle handles combined with weight of filled kettle make it difficult for users to lift and pour without straining wrists Fine motor skills required to open kettle trigger to pour hot water; difficult for many older users to maneuver Small opening on top makes it difficult to clean interior of kettle  The Process  The quest for the perfect interaction point between the spout and the handle (so the kettle would not open when carried around filled with water, but would open easily when tipped forward) led us to the current connection between the spout and handle, one that resembles a splash of water. The same connection point was also designed to keep the spout open if the user chose, so that they could keep the Uplift's whistle quiet while boiling water, which is especially handy when preparing an early morning cup of tea. While designing an opening large enough to be easy to clean, we needed to ensure it wasn't so low as to limit the maximum water level, but we still needed to keep it in balance with the spout for aesthetic reasons. Through user research, we learned that steam would sometimes escape from the lid and unfortunately heat the handle, so we added a silicone seal to minimize any unintended heat transfer and keep the kettle safe and easy to use.  OXO's Solutions  Large, comfortable handle is angled away from the spout and is heat resistant and non-slip, even when wet Handle angle allows user to hold Kettle comfortably and without wrist strain, whether filled with water or nearly empty, by adjusting grip accordingly Whistle spout opens automatically when Kettle is tipped to pour - no awkward buttons or levers to press Wide opening on top of Kettle enables easy access for cleaning and can also be used as an opening to fill Kettle  The OXO Story In 1990, OXO staged a revolution (of sorts) by offering an easy-to-use, high-performing alternative to uncomfortable and ineffective kitchen gadgets. OXO's innovative take on the traditional Swivel Peeler, complete with its pudgy black handle, raised consumers' expectations of what could be expected from household products.  Today OXO offers over 800 products, each developed with a close (some might say \"obsessive\") attention to detail. Our goal is to deliver products that maximize comfort AND performance, illustrating our mission to create innovative consumer products that make everyday living easier.  Ever wonder what makes an OXO product an \"OXO Product\"? OXO employees believe there are two rules that should guide product development: First, every new product must deliver a significant improvement over the status quo. Second, the functionality should never be sacrificed to make the product more attractive - above all it should work well.

An innovation in ceramics technology, Emile Henry's new line of Burgundy Clay Flame-Top ceramics products work directly on a gas flame or an electric or halogen hob without a diffuser, without any fear of cracking or breaking. Much lighter, (30%), than many types of comparable metal cookware products, Flame-Top is microwave and dishwasher-safe, cleans up very easily, is extremely strong and durable, goes under the broiler, and can go directly from a freezer or a refrigerator to a hot oven to the table, where it will retain the cooking heat for a very long time. This recent innovation from Emile Henry is a break-through in ceramics technology. Unlike most metal cookware products, Flame-Top cookware can sit on a very hot open flame for an extended period of time without any ingredients in the cook pot, and they will not crack, discolor or break. Perfect for braising, browning and slow cooking due to the incredibly gentle heat distribution properties of Burgundy Clay, Flame-Top products cook evenly and thoroughly when used on top of the stove, in the oven or even in the microwave. Enhancing this gentle cooking action are raised dots on the underneath side of each lid that evenly distribute evaporated juices directly back into the cooking food. This self-basting technique produces a more thoroughly cooked, tender and moist dish than with traditional lids, which force liquids to run down the sides of the pot, and which contribute to uneven cooking.

View larger    Attachments include chrome beaters, whisks, and dough hooks. View larger    Sunbeam's MixMaster stand mixer is the ultimate companion to gourmet creations.  Powerful Motor with 12 Speed Settings The countertop appliance comes equipped with a powerful 350-watt motor and 12 different speed settings for quickly and precisely mixing ingredients to perfection. Fold-knead, stir, blend, mix, cream, whip, and more.  The mixer's Soft Start mixing function helps minimize unnecessary splatter and messy flour puff by gently accelerating to the selected speed after start-up. The mixer also provides a burst-of-power function for an extra surge of power as needed to ensure even blending at any speed. Accessories for Added Versatility The stand mixer comes with three attachments: a pair of chrome beaters for making batter, meat loaf, and all textures in-between; a pair of whisks for egg whites, mayonnaise, creamy salad dressing, and other air-infused creations; and a pair of hooks for mixing and kneading yeast doughs.

The sandwich is then pressed between two grill plates to toast the bread and warm the filling. Experiment with a variety of savory or sweet sandwiches for any meal. We recommend using freshly baked bread to produce the best-tasting panini. Popular breads for panini are focaccia, michette, ciabatta, and thick slices of Italian bread. The Griddler\u2122 Panini & Sandwich Press was designed with a unique handle and hinge that allows the cover to adjust to the thickness of the sandwich you are preparing. This allows for even toasting and heating. Light pressure can be applied to the handle to press and heat the sandwich to your liking. When cooking two or more panini, it is important that the thickness of all sandwiches is the same so the cover will close evenly on the panini.

Adams: A 2nd-Generation, Family-Owned Company Kitchen storage solutions by J.K. Adams make it easy to save on valuable kitchen space while enjoying the best of USA-made craftsmanship. The family-owned company provides everything from pot hooks and spice bottles to wooden spice carousels, kitchen-knife blocks, bread boxes, wine racks, pot racks, and more. J.K. Adams' wooden kitchen items feature renewable and sustainable wood in Maple, Cherry, Walnut, Alder, Ash, or Hickory varieties. A thoughtful choice for gift giving, the high-quality kitchen items provide sleek designs and convenient functionality for year after year of everyday convenience. Innovative Kitchen-Storage Solutions In the late-1970's, when the gourmet-chef-tools market in the U.S. was still in its infancy, J.K. Adams owner Malcolm Cooper, Sr. conceived of the first slanted knife block. His goal was to create a cutlery organizer that would hold knives at a low enough angle that they could be easily removed from the block when it was pushed back under a cabinet overhang. The J.K. Adams Kangaroo knife block was launched in 1980--the first-ever slanted knife block, and still the best. Recognizing the many opportunities to improve kitchen storage, J.K. Adams introduced the revolving \"carousel\" spice rack in 1982 followed by countless other well-designed storage products in the years since, including the popular in-drawer knife tray in 1994, a space-saving alternative to the knife block that offers the same safety and blade protection. In 2011, J.K. Adams takes cutlery storage to a new level once again with the new Universal knife block. For over 30 years, J.K. Adams has continued to lead and inspire the kitchen storage market with their innovative designs, superior hardwoods, and exemplary craftsmanship.  Today, J.K. Adams continues to provide innovative designs, superior hardwoods, and high-quality craftsmanship. J.K. Adams: Over 65 Years of New England Yankee Craftsmanship          Some of the world's finest woodworkers can be found in New England. The rich heritage and folklore of the great Yankee Woodworker is as well known today as it was hundreds of years ago, and the craft has been handed down through the generations. J.K. Adams' success is certainly attributable to the early Vermonters employed by the company while in its infancy who brought forth the techniques and quality craftsmanship that could only come from generations of shared knowledge and experience. The J.K. Adams factory has been at the same location since the beginning. As many as three generations of families have relied on J.K. Adams to provide for their families. Located in a rural area of Vermont, J.K. Adams remains one of the largest employers in the area and is an important pillar of support for the local community. J.K. Adams has always used the creativity and skill of their workforce in developing new products, and today J.K. Adams continues its New England craftsmanship with a wide variety of cutting boards, as well as wooden salad bowls, kitchen islands, and slate serving trays. And at the J.K. Adams factory, you'll find future generations of woodworkers building upon the traditions begun over 65 years ago. Cutting boards and other products by J.K Adams are made in the North America.     About J.K. Adams' Logo In colonial New England, three strokes of a broad ax were used to mark the finest trees in the forest for the Queens' Navy shipmasts. The broad arrow was adopted as our logo because it symbolizes the exceptional quality of wood that goes into our products. J.K. Adams' Company History  Started over 65 years ago in a small garage in Dorset, Vermont Cooper family purchased business from founder Josiah K. Adams in 1949 Began with the Speedy Racer toy, and then followed by manufacturing drafting and surveying tables, Kiwi shoe groomers, gifts, and furniture Now the leading supplier of wooden storage and food preparation products for the specialty housewares industry   Our Wood  Maple, Cherry, Walnut, Alder, Ash, and Hickory Either from New England or other North American sources Renewable and sustainable Hard and durable, yet forgiving to knife edges  Wood Grains End Grain  Prized for look and longest wear Identifiable by small pieces put together Board usually thick and heavy Many pieces, lots of glue joints, cracking can be a problem  Edge Grain  Most common in cutting boards Moderate grain pattern Stable with minimum glue joints  Why Choose a Wood Cutting Board? Wood is naturally anti-bacterial, and any bacteria left on the board will actually lessen in time versus multiplying on a plastic cutting board. A wooden board will also be more gentle on your knife's edge, and it just feels and sounds better under a knife. Caring for Your J.K. Adams Cutting Board Wash by hand in warm soapy water and dry thoroughly, and oil frequently with mineral oil to help give it an optimal appearance. Do not soak, microwave, freeze, or put in the dishwasher. For removing stains, you can use a weak bleach-and-water solution or a combination of lemon juice and salt. Be sure to rinse and wipe with mineral oil afterward. Additionally, the surface can be sanded to make the board look like new--although a board with wear will add character to your kitchen. For storage, keep the board away from strong sunlight as avoiding UV rays will reduce the risk of fading.

To use the Pinzon Penguin Foil Cutter: Position the circular foil cutter over the top of the bottle. Press the sides of the cutter in lightly and twist a couple of times around the bottle. The foil top neatly removes to expose the cork.     To Use the Pinzon Penguin Wine Opener: 1. The sleek Penguin is designed to effortlessly remove a wine bottle cork. 2. Raise the lever and clamp the Penguin down over the neck of the bottle. 3. Grasp the rubberized inserts securely with one hand to hold the bottle steady. 4. Use the other hand to lower and then raise the lever in one smooth motion. (Although you can\u2019t see it, the corkscrew enters and pulls out the cork.) 5. With the lever up, lift the Penguin off the bottle. The cork will be inside the Penguin. 6. Lower and raise the lever again, and voil\u00e0! The cork slides off the corkscrew. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Note: The Penguin can be used to open wines bottled with regular corks, but careful use is advised when opening bottles with synthetic corks.  To Use the Pinzon Penguin Stopper: The stopper preserves for days on end the bouquet and flavor of a partially consumed bottle of wine. Plastic ridges on the stopper collar help provide an airtight seal.  To Replace a Corkscrew on the Pinzon Penguin Opener: Raise the lever and find the largest of three Phillips screws in the body of the Penguin. Unscrew the largest Phillips screw to release the corkscrew. Pull out the Penguin screw and insert the replacement underneath the lever. Then reinsert and screw in the Phillips screw from where it was removed.  Cleaning Instructions: Wipe clean with a damp towel and let air dry. Do not put into dishwasher. To Unlock the Pinzon Penguin Wine Opener: If the wine pull is not used correctly, the lever will lock itself. In order to release the mechanism:  Place the wine pull over an empty wine bottle neck.   Pull up and down in the action of opening a bottle of wine.    Never force the handle or it may break.

Why Buy Shun Classic: Born of the ancient samurai-sword-making tradition and hand-finished for precision and beauty, Shun Classic is an ideal choice for anyone buying their first Japanese knife or 50th. The high-quality line of cutlery makes a worthwhile addition to any chef's arsenal of tools--it's used by professional chefs and home cooks alike. Produced in the widest variety of specialized styles, the Classic line features both traditional European blade shapes and innovative cutting-edge designs. Shun Classic's amazingly sharp blade is famous for both edge retention and ease of sharpening. Each blade has a core of VG-10 \"Super Steel\" with a Pattern Damascus cladding of 32 layers of high-carbon stainless steel--16 layers on either side. While the wood grain pattern enhances the knife's beauty, it also adds durability and stain resistance, and reduces friction when cutting. NSF certified for use in commercial kitchens. Detailed Features  Blade core consists of high-carbon VG-10, a Japanese super steel known for its edge retention, allowing the knives to hold their sharp edges for years. Blades boast a 16-degree angle, making these the sharpest knives out of the box. This is sharper than traditional European blades, which are usually sharpened to 20-22 degrees. Clad with 16 layers of SUS410/SUS431 Pattern Damascus stainless steel on each side for strength and flexibility. This metal is corrosion-resistant and easy to maintain. Damascus styling adds to the beauty of the knife while the microscopic air pockets created by the cladding process reduces friction during slicing. D-shaped handle fits in the palm and provides comfort and control, keeping the knife's handle secure in the hand during use. Available standard in D-shaped handle styles or by special order in reverse D-shaped handle styles. Pakkawood handles, made of resin-impregnated hardwood, are NSF Certified for use in commercial kitchens. Produced in Seki City, Japan, the capital of samurai sword manufacturing. Rockwell hardness rating of 60-61 ensures that it takes and holds its incredibly sharp edge longer. Hand wash and dry recommended; limited lifetime warranty.    Specifications   Blade Material: VG-10 hardened Japanese steel cutting core, clad with 16 layers of SUS410/SUS431 Pattern Damascus stainless steel on each side, for a total of 33 layers of metal.   Bevel: Double-beveled   Cutting angle: 16 degrees per side (comprehensive angle 32 degrees). This is sharper than European knives, ground to 20-22 degrees per side.    Handle Material: PakkaWood (resin-impregnated hardwood); D-Shaped handle available in right and (by special order) left-handed versions.    Sharpening recommendations: Weekly honing to maintain the blade, sharpening as needed with professional sharpener or Asian-style electric sharpener.     Professional Manufacturing    View larger.

The soft gel is engineered to distribute your weight evenly and it can help prevent the fatigue, conforming to the shape of your feet and providing increased blood flow and soothing relief from the pressure. It's great for everyone, and especially helpful for those with back pain, foot pain, or arthritis.   The GelPro basketweave mat in truffle brown.   Whether your tastes are traditional, ultra-modern, rustic or something in between, the GelPro basketweave mat has universal appeal.  But more than just a mat for the kitchen, the GelPro mat is perfect for any room in your home where you stand on hard flooring for an extended period of time can cause fatigue and discomfort in the feet, legs and lower back--including the bathroom, laundry/utility room, garage or game room. This mat measures 20 by 72 inches and comes in a truffle brown color that is easily paired with a wood-themed decor or with the finest leather furniture. The basketweave construction has the appearance of interwoven leather strips, but is actually a one-piece high performance coated textile.  Familiar and clean in design, each GelPro mat is made from a three-dimensional texture that feels wonderful under foot and it's constructed from high quality composite leather fabrics--resulting in a mat that is more versatile, more durable and easier to clean. The non-slip bottom is made from a durable polyester knit base fabric that is hypo-allergenic and non-irritating. It's also engineered to resist bacteria, mold, and algae that can cause stains, odors and product deterioration, and it also contains an anti-static compatibility ingredient that limits the mats movement on most hard flooring surfaces.  The Technology Behind GelPro The most distinguishing characteristic of the GelPro mat is the soft, shock-absorbing gel core that's used as the support mechanism, as opposed to the foam used by other household mats. When you step on a foam mat, your weight typically stays in one spot as the foam compresses making the mat harder at the point of contact. A GelPro mat, by contrast, contours to your feet as weight is applied and pushes evenly the entire time you are on the mat. This contouring characteristic takes place instantaneously each time you step on your GelPro mat and continues throughout the duration of your time on the mat.      The unique properties of the gel enable GelPro mats to provide the most comfortable surface to stand on, regardless of the type of hard flooring you have in your home.  Advanced Medical Anti-Fatigue Everyone can benefit from the comfort provided by a GelPro mat. There are, however, millions of individuals that are especially susceptible to hard, unforgiving flooring. Chief among them--young and old alike--are those with painful arthritis, lower back pain, foot pain, plantar fasciitis, and diabetes, which are all exacerbated by standing on hard flooring  GelPro mats have unique and unsurpassed ergonomic properties to help counter these irritating and disabling pains. While GelPro mats are not a solution for serious medical conditions, they can help prevent the fatigue that causes muscles strains and spasms that can lead to irritated nerves and pain in your back.", "salesrank_2018": "1140599"}, "B000FSHE3I": {"description": "Convenient crescent design with lower shelf, drawer and turned legs", "salesrank_2018": "16636"}, "B000FSKM3W": {"description": "S/2 Natural/White 24\" Barstools shipped fully assembled compliment today's crisp d\u00e9cor style.

View larger   Simple Push-Button Operation Before removing the cork, any foil seal covering the cork must be removed first. A handy foil cutter comes included making the task quick and easy. To use the electric wine bottle opener, place it on top of a wine bottle, making sure it remains in an upright position and not at an angle to the bottle. A single operating switch ensures foolproof operation from here. Simply press the lower part of the switch to start. The unit's corkscrew spiral will turn to enter the cork, then it will gradually remove the cork from the bottle, stopping once the cork has been fully removed from the bottle. Lift the electric wine bottle opener away from the bottle, and remove the cork by pressing the upper part of the switch--the spiral turns in the opposite direction to release the cork. Voila. Let the pouring begin. Opens up to 30 Bottles on a Full Charge Measuring 2-1/4 inches in diameter by 10-3/4 inches tall, the electric wine bottle opener provides an ergonomically designed, soft-grip handle that fits in the palm of your hand for a firm grip. Other highlights include an LED charging light on the top of the unit and a power indicator light on the base, which offers a small footprint that takes up minimal space on a kitchen counter, bar, table, or buffet.
