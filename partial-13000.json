Menu settings include: white rice (regular, softer or harder), sushi rice, mixed rice, porridge, sweet GABA brown, quick cooking, and rinse-free. Make Every Type of Rice  Brown Rice This is a menu setting designed to cook delicious brown rice. In order to cook hard rice bran and the rice inside, preheating time is extended for better absorption of water, and is cooked at a lower temperature to allow the rice to cook longer without becoming mushy. Sushi Rice Because sushi rice will be processed after it's cooked, it's easier to handle when it is a little firmer. This menu setting is very similar to regular white rice, but uses less water (adjusted by the water fill lines) for a firm finish. Mixed Rice Mixed rice is rice cooked with additional ingredients and seasonings. This setting extends preheating for better absorption of seasoning. Also, the cooking temperature is slightly lower than regular white rice, to avoid ingredients from boiling over. Porridge Instead of cooking rice in larger amounts of water and risk making it sloppy, use the porridge setting to cook fluffy porridge. Cooking temperature is slightly lower than regular white rice, to be cooked longer for soft texture.  GABA Brown Rice A newly discovered way of cooking brown rice to \"activate\" it and increase natural occurring gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), an amino acid in brown rice believed to have health giving properties such as lowering blood pressure, improving kidney function and relieving stress. The brown rice is \"activated\" by soaking it at 104\u00b0F for 2 hours before the actual cooking begins. All Induction Heating System rice cookers, including the IH Pressure models, have the GABA brown rice setting. Easy-to-read LCD control panel MICOM (Microcomputer) Technology Aided by microcomputer technology, this category of rice cooker takes having rice on your menu from occasional to serious. MICOM allows the cooker to have multiple functions on its menu, making it a necessity for any avid rice fan who wants to incorporate rice into her daily diet. The microchip does all the thinking for you by, based on the type of rice you are cooking, from adjusting cooking times, temperatures, and timing the pre-soak of the raw grains to the final \"wait\" period during steaming. Conventional rice cookers simply turn on and off in reaction to temperature. The \"fuzzy logic\" of MICOM fine-tunes this adjustment to adapt to various rice types, such as white, brown, sweet or porridge, which all have different cooking requirements. The trigger to everything is the thermal sensor, a small round button at the bottom of the inner body of the cooker. As the inner pan's weight rests on it and activates the sensor, it starts the cooking process and keeps an eye on the temperature and time.   Induction Heating (IH) system for precise temperature control Induction Heating took rice cooking to another level by introducing another dimension to the heating process. Where the heating element would normally be located at the bottom of the cooker, IH transforms the entire inner cooking pan into a heat conductor, allowing for higher, more precise and more uniform cooking temperatures. Induction heating occurs when a magnetic material enters a magnetic field. This is recreated by passing an electric current through coils located at the bottom of the rice cooker's body. As the special, 2-ply inner cooking pan is placed inside, a magnetic field is created, which in turn generates instant heat. The entire cooking pan becomes the heat source, with the ability to cook at higher temperatures, which can be turned on and off instantly for greater control. Automatically selects from 3 pressure levels Vacuum Insulated Inner Pan Our vacuum insulated inner cooking pan distributes heat to the rice quickly without allowing it to escape outside. Vacuum insulation prevents the heat induced by IH from escaping outside, to produce better cooking results. IH Pressure System When pressure is added to the equation, even higher temperatures occur, resulting in a change in the structure of the starch within each grain of rice. This change makes the rice softer and easier to digest, and even fluffier to the taste. Rice cooked with pressure has also been found to stay soft for longer periods of time when compared to regular cooked rice. A specially designed lid keeps the cooker airtight and sealed, which prevents the steam from escaping. As pressure builds inside while the rice cooks, the boiling point of the water increases beyond the normal 212 F. Once the water is allowed to boil, it cannot be heated further; but inside a sealed environment under pressure, higher temperatures can be reached, which penetrates everything in the cooker from the surface of the food to its center.

The Jet soda maker carbonates water in a BPA-free, reusable one-liter bottle in less than 30 seconds, without electricity or batteries, and with no clean-up. After loading the carbonator into the soda-maker, fill the bottle with regular tap or filtered water and place it in the soda maker. Just pump the button a few times to add the fizz and in seconds you will have a liter of fresh, tasty soda or sparkling water in a resealable bottle that stores compactly in your fridge. When the CO2 carbonator is empty, you can visit the SodaStream web site to purchase a new CO2 cylinder as well as set up a cylinder exchange, which helps to eliminate waste. SodaStream collects your empty cylinder and returns it to our filling facility where it's cleaned, inspected and refilled. The SodaStream Jet measures 16.7 by 5.3 by 7.9 inches (HxWxD) and weighs 2.58 pounds. How Does SodaStream Help the Environment? SodaStream is an \"Active Green\" company, meaning that consumers actively minimize their CO2 footprint when using the SodaStream system. The more the system is used on a daily basis, the more CO2 footprint the user actively saves. This differs from \"Passive Green\" brands, which use green-friendly production processes, but their products are not inherently helping you save on your daily footprint. Because SodaStream uses water straight from the tap, the system makes traditional store-bought beverage bottles obsolete. That means, less plastic manufactured, less plastic waste and less transport of bottled beverages. Globally, 206 billion liters of bottled water were consumed in 2008 (Zenith International Global Bottled Water Report, 2008), and the energy required to make water bottles just in the US is equivalent to 17 million barrels of oil (Container Recycling Institute, 2002). A family of four could slash their home soft-drink-related packaging usage by over 90 percent simply by using a SodaStream soda maker, and SodaStream's plastic carbonating bottle are reusable for up to three years. A typical American will toss away over 1500 aluminum cans (and/or hundreds of plastic 2-liter bottles) over three years, while a SodaStream owner will use just one carbonating bottle or carafe that come with the home soda maker. Operating without batteries or electricity, SodaStream home soda makers are highly energy-efficient small appliances. Appliances that work without electricity improve the environment by cutting down on the emissions generated by electrical plants, giving us cleaner air and ground water. By operating completely on power supplied by the compressed air in the carbonator--an easily renewable fuel source--SodaStream does not contribute to environmental pollution made by batteries. Empty carbonators are returned to SodaStream to be cleaned, inspected and refilled with CO2 drawn naturally from the air. Carbonators are reusable as long as they remain in good condition. Frequently Asked Questions Can I carbonate drinks other than water? No. Only water should be carbonated in the SodaStream home soda maker. You risk damaging your soda maker, not to mention making a big fizzy mess. The money-back guarantee and the warranty are both invalidated if you carbonate any liquid other than water in your soda maker. Why does the carbonating bottle have an expiration date? Since the bottle has to withstand recurring pressure from carbonation, it cannot be used forever. The expiration date on the bottle must be checked and new bottles purchased as soon as the former expires. The bottles must also be replaced if put in the dishwasher, exposed to a heat source, or if they have become scratched. All components of carbonating bottles are recyclable. Check with your local recycling authority for more information. How do I clean my carbonating bottles? Carbonating bottles may be cleaned in warm water with a bottle brush and regular dish-washing liquid if necessary. Please do not place carbonating bottles in the dishwasher, as exposure to extreme heat can weaken the integrity of the bottles. Bottles stay cleanest when rinsed and then immediately filled with fresh water and returned to your refrigerator. Plus, you'll always have cold water on hand when you're ready for your next bottle of soda. How long does the soda last before going flat? The hermetic seal on the cap keeps your soda from going flat as quickly as ordinary store-bought beverages. If you make sure to close the cap tightly, and keep the bottle in the refrigerator, your SodaStream soda should remain fizzy and fresh for over a week. How often will I have to replace my carbonator? On average, the carbonator will make 60 liters of soda, and this number could be more or less depending on the amount of carbonation used when making your drink. A household of four soda drinkers might need to replace a 60-liter carbonator every 6-8 weeks, depending on usage. Are SodaStream products kosher? SodaStream products are kosher (OU) certified (OU kosher certificate). SodaStream seltzer is kosher for Passover (OUP). Also, please note that your home drink smaker can be used on the Sabbath.", "salesrank_2018": "104631"}, "B001KYVJSC": {"description": "Take the bad part out of the fart with Subtle Butt fart pads.

Every Breville product begins with a simple moment of brilliance. The Breville Smart Oven began with the simple fact that different foods require different methods of heating: some, like baked goods, need to be cooked evenly; others, like meats, need to be seared on top. Most toaster ovens fail to distribute heat in a consistent way throughout their interiors, let alone change heat distribution to suit the different foods being prepared. This is how the Breville Smart Oven stands apart: whatever the food, it adjusts its heat distribution for perfect results.  For toast, high heat from top and bottom evenly crisps the outside of toast but doesn't dry out the inside (left diagram), while for baking 1500W are distributed among four elements for gentle heat and even cooking (right diagram)  An oven that does the thinking for you   The Smart Oven is equipped with Element IQ cooking technology, which adjusts the power of the five individual quartz heating elements to cook food more evenly and quickly. This sophisticated heating system distributes heat throughout the oven when and where it is needed, to guarantee more efficient cooking. Nine different menu options allow users to choose the best setting for the food they are cooking. In addition to dynamically distributing heat to different areas, the Smart Oven can adjust the wattage of its heating elements for even more cooking flexibility. Most ovens have elements with fixed wattage that can only switch between ON and OFF, but Element IQ functions much like a dimmer on a light switch, increasing or decreasing element power with a simple turn of the knob.   The Breville Smart Oven comes with 3 acccessories: a pizza pan, baking pan, and broil rack.  For example, broiling requires high heat from above in order to melt and brown, so the Smart Oven activates 1500W of high heat from the top elements of the oven. On the other hand, toast needs to be cooked evenly on both sides without drying out the inside, so the Smart Oven uses high radiated heat from above and below (1800W distributed between four elements) to crisp the outside quickly.  Baking utilizes another feature of the Smart Oven that contributes to even heating: convection heating. Convection cooking uses a fan to circulate hot air so all sides of the food cook at the same rate. This is particularly important for baked goods, such as cookies and cakes, which need to be cooked evenly all the way through.  Each of these nine functions is preset with recommended settings, taking the guesswork out of cooking. However, each can be customized according to recipe, volume of food, or personal taste. Customized settings will remain in the memory of the oven until changed or until the oven is unplugged from the wall outlet, streamlining your cooking process.  Designed with the consumer in mind  The Smart Oven is carefully constructed from the most durable materials. It is attractively housed in reinforced stainless steel, a striking addition to any kitchen. The elements themselves are composed of quartz, rather than the metal elements found in other toaster ovens. Quartz responds more quickly to heat change, which results in more even heating throughout the oven. The roomy interior is coated with a non-stick material that can safely withstand high temperatures, making cleanup easier. A crumb/drip tray that is accessible from the front of the oven (rather than the back, like many other toaster ovens) also makes it easier to clean between cooking sessions. In addition, the oven includes a patented magnetic auto-eject rack: small magnets embedded on the sides of the oven door pull the wire rack halfway from the oven when the door is opened, making food easier to remove and preventing burns.  Goldilocks proportions At 18.5 x16.25 x11.25 inches, the Breville Smart Oven is not too small but not too large. It is larger than most toaster ovens, with space to comfortably fit six slices of toast, a 13-inch pizza, or a whole chicken. However, as a countertop convection oven, it is more space-efficient than a conventional wall oven. A smaller oven means less time to heat up and less time to cook, perfect for preparing a meal in a hurry (or for cooks who like to create in the heat of the moment). This also translates into a cooler kitchen (particularly convenient in the hot summer months) and less energy consumed.

The low speed protects and maintains healthy enzymes, prevents oxidation and allows juice to be stored up to 72 hours without degradation. The GE Ultem Auger is 8x stronger than most other plastics and the powerful gear reduction is equivalent to a 2HP Motor. The dual stage juice processing system extracts the maximum amount of juice from fruits, vegetables, leafy greens, even wheatgrass! You can also use the nutrition center to turn nuts into nut butters (an all-natural peanut butter), make baby food from natural, fresh ingredients, whip up soy milk, extrude pasta, grind coffee and spices, and mince herbs and garlic.

Product Features  Low speed, masticating style juicing system Omega's Nutrition Center does more than just juice. You can turn nuts into nut butters (an all-natural peanut butter), make baby food from natural, fresh ingredients, whip up soy milk, extrude pasta, grind coffee and spices, and mince herbs and garlic. Includes a GE Ultem Auger which is 8x stronger than most other plastics. Powerful gear reduction is equivalent to a 2HP Motor. Juicer processes at 80rpm's. Low speed or masticating style juicer squeezes, instead of grinding, which allows the juice to maintain its pure color, natural taste, vitamins and nutrients. Dual stage juicer. First, juice is extracted by crushing the fruit or vegetable. Then, before the pulp is ejected, the pulp is squeezed during the second pressed stage. This results in a higher yield of juice and a very dry pulp. Extracts the maximum amount of nutrients, vitamins, taste and juice from minimum amounts of fruits, vegetables, leafy greens such as spinach and kale, even wheatgrass.  Economical. Since the juicer is so efficient and productive, you'll get the greatest amount of juice from the least amount of produce.  The low speed system does not mean a longer time to juice. It means a more efficient juicer. More nutrients and antioxidants, plus better flavored juice and freshness.  Engineered for quiet operation and longer life.  The low speed system limits froth and foam preventing oxidation.  Juice can be stored for up to 72 hours without degradation or the juice separation that occurs with other juicers.     This juicer efficiently juices hard and soft fruits and vegetables without destroying the natural flavor and nutritional benefits.   The food processor attachment chops and minces, providing natural flavor and nutrition from garlic, scallions, red pepper, ginger, and most other foods, including herbs and seasonings. Soft foods for special diets for babies are quick and easy to prepare with the mincing set-up.     Homemade spaghetti, linguini, or breadsticks can be extruded in just minutes with the included pasta nozzles.   Use the homogenizer attachment to make fresh frozen desserts, natural baby food, and nut butters (an all-natural form of peanut butter.)

When Bodum took over a small clarinet factory in Normandy in 1982, it was not because of the fine orchestra clarinets they were producing but because of a relatively unknown coffee maker called the Chambord which they produced as well. The reason the French press coffeemaker has become one of the most popular coffeemakers in the world is pure and simple- taste. The materials are completely taste-free so nothing comes between your ground coffee beans. This is exactly the reason why coffee tasters use this method to determine the quality of coffee beans. The 3-part stainless steel plunger has a fine mesh filter, which allows for a premium extraction of your coffee\u2019s aromatic oils and subtle flavors. A mesh filter allows this flavor to be delivered direct to your cup and not absorbed by a paper filter. Plus, no paper filter means no waste! The patented safety lid prevents the splashing of liquids while pressing. Simplicity works best and is the reason why the Chambord\u2019s design has not changed a bit from its original drawing.

The compact unit's ingenious steaming technology requires no harsh chemicals. Instead harnessing the power of pure steam to loosen and remove even the toughest dirt and grime. Cleans bare floors with a high degree of hygienic and degreasing power The Eureka Hard Surface Floor Steamer achieves a high degree of hygienic and degreasing power on floors. It turns water into steam in just a few minutes, so when contact is made with surfaces dirt and grime is removed. Since the floor steamer uses the active power of steam without the use of detergents or soap, it is safe for the environment. Furthermore, its generous 12-1/2-inch cleaning head maneuvers easily into corners and clean hard to reach areas. The length of the cleaning head helps reduce time to cover even large floor surfaces, while its 25-foot cord allows for hassle-free access all over a home, condo, or apartment. Another key feature of this vacuum is that the steamer weighs only 5-1/2 pounds when empty. The Eureka Enviro Hard Surface Steam Cleaner eliminates the need for lugging around cumbersome wet vacuums or mops and buckets around to get the job done. Ideal for people who want eco-friendlier cleaning products The floor steamer is a new way of cleaning that is effective and hygienic. Under normal conditions, the floor steamer does not allow calcium deposits to adhere to the boiler so tap water is acceptable for use. Areas with hard water should use distilled water for better performance. The floor steamer can kill dust mites and some types of bacteria, such as salmonella and E-coli when used properly. Getting the Best Results   \u2022 To disinfect a specific area, position the steamer over the area for a minimum of eight seconds. This allows the floor under the steamer to reach approximately 170\u00b0F. Use this procedure to disinfect floors near: bathroom stools, food preparation areas (not on kitchen counters), pet sleeping quarters, etc.   \u2022 On surfaces that have been treated with wax or on some no wax floors, the sheen may be removed by the heat and steam action. Do not use on unsealed wood floors or let unit stand on any wood floor for an extended period of time. This could cause the wood grain to rise. It is therefore recommended that a sample cleansing be carried out on an isolated area of the floor.   \u2022 In order to guarantee perfect functioning over a long period of time, the tank needs to be rinsed out with water once a month to eliminate any accumulated calcium deposits. Do not use vinegar or other decalcifying substances. Put in two measures of water, replace the safety cap and shake to loosen deposits. Remove safety cap and immediately empty water into a sink.   \u2022 Ideally designed to thoroughly clean floor surfaces such as marble, ceramic, stone, linoleum, sealed hard wood floors and parquet.   \u2022 Please note, the product may appear to \"leak\" during the first couple uses. This is caused by super heated water caused by the initial lack of nucleation sites comes out of the steam holes for a few seconds before steam is produces. To prevent water from leaking on the floor, please leave mop on heating pad for an extra minute before using. It is also best to use tap water, as distilled water will make this more likely. Following the first 1-3 uses (once nucleation sites have been created) this will no longer occur.   Steam goes through the magic cloth which clips easily to the base and is machine-washable Cleaning head maneuvers easily into corners and cleans hard to reach areas  Product Features  \u2022 Simple on and off switch   \u2022 6-1/2 amps of power  \u2022 An indicator light for water levels   \u2022 An adjustable-height handle   \u2022 A preheating/cool-down tray for safety, and a cloth clip    Yellow and green indication lights on the base let you know when the product is heating up and ready to use This hard floor steamer comes with a measuring cup, a funnel and two magic cloth steam pads  \u2022 A measuring cup, funnel, and two magic cloth steam pads   \u2022 Additional replacement pads available separately   \u2022 The steamer measures 7 by 12.5 by 49 inches  \u2022 Carries a one-year limited warranty.

The fully automatic unit can be programmed up to 24 hours in advance for \"wake up\" coffee or to have a pot ready and waiting to serve with dessert--no need to get up from the table half way through dinner. For those eager to start their day, the machine's brew-pause function allows for pouring a quick cup midbrew--simply remove the carafe to pause the flow of coffee and replace it to continue the brewing cycle. Speaking of, the included glass carafe offers measuring marks up the side, an ergonomic stay-cool handle with a knuckle guard and a strip of stainless-steel accenting, and a drip-free spout for graceful pouring. The coffeemaker also provides an easy-view water-level window; a 1- to 4-cup setting; regular and bold flavor-strength settings; built-in 60-second memory in case the power goes out; an adjustable heater plate with high, medium, and low temperature settings; a self-clean function; and 0- to 4-hour automatic shut-off for safety and peace of mind. A permanent Gold Tone filter that eliminates messy paper filters, a charcoal water filter for improved flavor, and a handy instruction book come included. The coffeemaker measures approximately 11 by 9-3/5 by 16-1/5 inches and carries a three-year limited warranty. From the Manufacturer   The Cuisinart DCC-2600 14-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker The Quest for a Perfect Cup of Coffee It is generally agreed that there are four basic elements critical to the perfect cup:    Water & Coffee Filters  Element 1. Water: Coffee is 98% water. Often overlooked, the quality of the water is as important as the quality of the coffee. A good rule of thumb is that if your water doesn\u2019t taste good from the tap, it won\u2019t taste any better in your coffee. That\u2019s why Cuisinart has added a water filter to the 14-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker. The charcoal water filter removes chlorine, bad tastes and odors, for the purest cup of coffee every time.  Element 2. Coffee: While the bulk of the liquid is water, all of the flavor should be from the coffee. To achieve the same great quality of coffee you receive at a coffee bar, you need to use the same quality beans. Buy the beans fresh and whole, only about a two weeks\u2019 supply at a time for maximum freshness. Once the coffee bean is broken, its flavor degrades very quickly. If it is not practical to buy small supplies, we recommend you separate larger amounts of beans into one to two week portions immediately after purchase, and freeze them in airtight containers. The best way to maximize freshness is to minimize exposure to air, light and moisture. So, once removed from the freezer, beans should be maintained in a sealed container at room temperature, since damaging condensation occurs every time the beans are removed from the freezer or refrigerator. Note that some coffee experts advise against freezing dark-roast beans, because freezing can cause the oils to coagulate. Other experts disagree. We suggest you experiment and decide yourself.    The Perfect Cup of Coffee  Element 3. Grind:  The grind of the coffee is critical for proper flavor extraction. If the grind is too fine, over extraction and bitterness will result. Too fine a grind may also clog the filter. If the grind is too coarse, the water will pass through too quickly and the desired flavors will not be extracted. A medium-fine grind is recommended.  Element 4. Proportion: Coffee that is too strong or too weak is always a disappointment. Add 1 level scoop of ground coffee per cup and adjust the amount according to taste. Note: the maximum capacity for ground coffee is 17 tablespoons for the 12-cup coffeemaker. Exceeding this amount may cause overflow if the coffee is too finely ground.    Features and Benefits  Reservoir Cover: Flips back for easy filling. Water Reservoir with Water Level Indicator Window: Open the reservoir cover by lifting it up. Pour in the desired amount of water using the water level indicator located at the side of the coffeemaker window. Showerhead: Distributes water evenly over coffee, reducing temperature loss as water passes through grounds. Charcoal Water Filter: Charcoal water filter eliminates chlorine, calcium and bad tastes or odors from tap water. Cuisinart recommends changing the water filter every 60 days or 60 uses \u2013 or more often if you have hard water. Filter Basket: Holds a #4 paper filter or a permanent filter. Control Panel:   LCD & Controls   On/Off Button, Clock display, Hour and Minute Buttons. Strength Selector: Regular and Bold buttons let you choose the intensity of coffee flavor you prefer. Carafe Temperature Knob: For controlling the temperature of the coffee after brewing. There are three temperature settings high, medium and low. 1- to 4-Cup Setting: The 1- to 4-cup setting button is used when you make small amounts of coffee. Normal coffeemakers will produce a colder batch of coffee when smaller amounts are made, because the heater doesn\u2019t have enough time to properly \u2018warm up\u2019 to heat a small amount. The 1- to 4-cup setting basically \u2018double heats\u2019 the water, making your smaller amounts as piping hot as a full pot would be. To use simply press the 1- to 4-cup button on the control panel after turning on the unit. Self-Clean Setting: Tells you when it\u2019s time to clean your coffeemaker. Remove built-up calcification from the water reservoir, to help extend the life of your coffeemaker.  Function Knob: Includes Program, Auto On, Auto Off, Brew, Clock and Audible Tone: Coffeemaker can be programmable to automatically start brewing up to 24 hours in advance and can be programmed to shut off up to 4 hours after brewing. The Audible Tone signals the end of the brew cycle with five beeps (coffee will continue to stream from the filter for a few seconds after the tone). Brew Pause: Stops flow of coffee from basket when carafe is removed (30 seconds max) from the heater plate, so a cup can be poured in mid-brew. Since the flavor extraction rate varies during the brew cycle, we recommend allowing the brewing cycle to finish before pouring the coffee. The coffee brewed at the beginning of the cycle has a flavor profile which is very different from the flavor at the end of the cycle. Once the coffee has finished brewing, stir it before serving to blend the flavors. The coffee at the bottom of the carafe will be somewhat stronger than the coffee at the top. Carafe: The easy pour, no drip 14-cup glass carafe has an ergonomic handle and brewed coffee markings for two to fourteen cups.  Adjustable Heater Plate: Allows you to keep brewed coffee at desired temperature. Scratch resistant with black, nonstick coating.

And with this SodaStream Genesis Starter Kit, you've got everything you need to turn tap water into sparkling water in 30 seconds--thus saving you money . This white SodaStream Pure soda maker comes with two BPA-free plastic 1-liter bottles and one CO2 cylinder that will make up to 60 liters of sparkling water. With no batteries or electricity, you can use your soda maker in your kitchen, outdoors on your patio or deck, or on your boat or R.V.          In addition to making fizzy water, SodaStream also offers more than 25 regular, diet, energy and caffeine-free flavors of syrup (sold separately). Each 500ml soda mix bottle makes the equivalent of 12 liters of soda (about 33 cans). And with over 25 flavors, the possibilities for creative beverages are limited only by your imagination. How about a Creamsicle (Orange and Cream Soda), or a Japanese Beetle (Ginger Ale and Lemon-Lime)? The regular soda mixes contain no high fructose corn syrup, while the diet soda mixes contain no aspartame.  The benefits of the SodaStream drinks maker, compared to ready made bottled drinks:  Provides an endless supply of sparkling water, freshly made from tap water in just a few seconds. No more need to buy, carry or store large quantities of heavy and bulky bottles. A wide variety of flavors are produced by SodaStream. The ability to make sparkling water as strong or as weak as one likes, makes the machine an ideal solution for the family's entire sparkling beverage needs.   The SodaStream Pure Starter Kit bundles the soda maker with one 60L carbonator and two BPA-free carbonating bottles.  The Pure soda maker carbonates water in a BPA-free, reusable one-liter bottle in less than 30 seconds, without electricity or batteries, and with no clean-up. After loading the carbonator into the soda-maker, fill the bottle with regular tap or filtered water and place it in the soda maker. Just pump the button a few times to add the fizz and in seconds you will have a liter of fresh, tasty soda or sparkling water in a resealable bottle that stores compactly in your fridge.  Each BPA-free carbonating bottle has a lifespan of 3 years and is not made with any polycarbonate materials or substances that produce phthalates or PCBs. Each bottle includes a special hermetic sealing cap that keeps drinks fresh and fizzy much longer than store-bought bottles. SodaStream bottles are specially designed for high-pressure resistance and are the only bottles that can be used with SodaStream soda makers.  When the CO2 carbonator is empty, you can visit the SodaStream web site to purchase a new CO2 cylinder as well as set up a cylinder exchange, which helps to eliminate waste. SodaStream collects your empty cylinder and returns it to our filling facility where it's cleaned, inspected and refilled.  The SodaStream Pure measures 16.7 by 5.7 by 9.4 inches (HxWxD) and weighs 3.75 pounds.  How Does SodaStream Help the Environment? SodaStream is an \"Active Green\" company, meaning that consumers actively minimize their CO2 footprint when using the SodaStream system. The more the system is used on a daily basis, the more CO2 footprint the user actively saves. This differs from \"Passive Green\" brands, which use green-friendly production processes, but their products are not inherently helping you save on your daily footprint.  Because SodaStream uses water straight from the tap, the system makes traditional store-bought beverage bottles obsolete. That means, less plastic manufactured, less plastic waste and less transport of bottled beverages. Globally, 206 billion liters of bottled water were consumed in 2008 (Zenith International Global Bottled Water Report, 2008), and the energy required to make water bottles just in the US is equivalent to 17 million barrels of oil (Container Recycling Institute, 2002).  A family of four could slash their home soft-drink-related packaging usage by over 90 percent simply by using a SodaStream soda maker, and SodaStream's plastic carbonating bottles are reusable for up to three years. A typical American will toss away over 1500 aluminum cans (and/or hundreds of plastic 2-liter bottles) over three years, while a SodaStream owner will use just one or two reusable carbonating bottles or carafes that come with the home soda maker.  Operating without batteries or electricity, SodaStream home soda makers are highly energy-efficient small appliances. Appliances that work without electricity improve the environment by cutting down on the emissions generated by electrical plants, giving us cleaner air and ground water.  By operating completely on power supplied by the compressed air in the carbonator--an easily renewable fuel source--SodaStream does not contribute to environmental pollution made by batteries. Empty carbonators are returned to SodaStream to be cleaned, inspected and refilled with CO2 drawn naturally from the air. Carbonators are reusable as long as they remain in good condition. Frequently Asked Questions Can I carbonate drinks other than water? No. Only water should be carbonated in the SodaStream home soda maker. You risk damaging your soda maker, not to mention making a big fizzy mess. The money-back guarantee and the warranty are both invalidated if you carbonate any liquid other than water in your soda maker.  Why does the carbonating bottle have an expiration date? Since the bottle has to withstand recurring pressure from carbonation, it cannot be used forever. The expiration date on the bottle must be checked and new bottles purchased as soon as the former expires. The bottles must also be replaced if put in the dishwasher, exposed to a heat source, or if they have become scratched. All components of carbonating bottles are recyclable. Check with your local recycling authority for more information.  How do I clean my carbonating bottles? Carbonating bottles may be cleaned in warm water with a bottle brush and regular dish-washing liquid if necessary. Please do not place carbonating bottles in the dishwasher, as exposure to extreme heat can weaken the integrity of the bottles. Bottles stay cleanest when rinsed and then immediately filled with fresh water and returned to your refrigerator. Plus, you'll always have cold water on hand when you're ready for your next bottle of soda.  How long does the soda last before going flat? The hermetic seal on the cap keeps your soda from going flat as quickly as ordinary store-bought beverages. If you make sure to close the cap tightly, and keep the bottle in the refrigerator, your SodaStream soda should remain fizzy and fresh for over a week.  How often will I have to replace my carbonator? On average, the carbonator will make 60 liters of soda, and this number could be more or less depending on the amount of carbonation used when making your drink. A household of four soda drinkers might need to replace a 60-liter carbonator every 6-8 weeks, depending on usage.  Are SodaStream products kosher? SodaStream products are kosher (OU) certified (OU kosher certificate). SodaStream seltzer is kosher for Passover (OUP). Also, please note that your home drink smaker can be used on the Sabbath.", "salesrank_2018": "886391"}, "B001NZPP6U": {"description": "The Excalibur 2900ECB comes with 9 trays, a total of 15 square feet of drying space.

The fan, heating element and thermostat are in the back of the unit, so cool air is drawn in, heated and then distributed evenly over each tray. This patented Parallex Horizontal Airflow is exclusive to Excalibur and helps the food to dehydrate faster, retain more nutrients and look and taste better, without tray rotation. Since 1973, Excalibur has been made in Sacramento, California. Over the years, Excalibur has taken the lead in advancements related to the mechanics of dehydration including air flow, heating dynamics, and materials. Any dehydrator will dry food. An Excalibur dries better, faster & safer thanks to Excalibur\u2019s patented Hyperwave Fluctuation technology. Ordinary dehydrators produce constant, unchanging heat causing \u201ccase hardening.\u201d Basically a dry surface with moisture trapped inside \u2013 the perfect environment for yeast, mold and bacteria growth. With the Excalibur Hyperwave Fluctuation technology the air temperature fluctuates up and the food\u2019s surface moisture evaporates, then the air temperature fluctuates down and the inner moisture moves to the drier surface.

Coffee is brewed by placing the coffee and water together, leaving to brew for a few minutes, then depressing the plunger to trap the coffee grinds at the bottom of the glass jug. A French press requires coffee of a more coarse grind than that used for a drip brew coffee filter, such as produced by a burr mill grinder rather than the whirling blade variety, as a finer grind will seep through the press filter and into the coffee. Because the coffee grounds remain in direct contact with the brewing water and the grinds are filtered from the water via a mesh instead of a paper filter, coffee brewed with the French press captures more of the coffee's flavour and essential oils, which would become trapped in a traditional drip brew machine's paper filters.

AirBake continues to provide the best baking results every time. Made of 100-percent aluminum, AirBake Natural provides an overall enhanced baking performance with its insulated aluminum sheets and micro-dome technology to decrease bake times by up to 15% over traditional insulated bakeware. Two heavyweight aluminum sheets surround a layer of air. The air reduces the temperature of the metal that comes in contact with the food. The bottom sheet blocks the direct oven heat while the layer of air acts as an insulator preventing the top sheet from overheating. This means better browning, no burning, and moister baked goods.

Avoid overheating your bakeware. In order to preserve and avoid scratches on your coating, we recommend the use of plastic utensils. Slight surface marks or abrasions are normal and will not affect the performance of the non-stick coating. With use, the non-stick surface may become slightly darker.

The HealthSmart Juice Extractor is ideal for the novice juice drinker or aspiring health nut, with its easy-to-use features, included recipes and tips  Eating healthy and incorporating fruits and veggies into snacks or meals doesn't have to be expensive or time-consuming. The perfect upgrade from a simple citrus juicer to a multi-purpose juicing machine, the HealthSmart Juice Extractor has a powerful 400-watt motor and durable stainless steel cutter/strainer to juice hearty fruits and vegetables \u2013 apples, carrots, pineapples, carrots, celery and more \u2013 in hefty quantities.  The HealthSmart Juice Extractor livens up produce by taking fruits and vegetables that are in season or in-stock year round and turning them into juice mixtures that taste fresh and delicious without the need for sugar or preservatives. So forget about those expensive, store-bought juice drinks, smoothies and sugary sports drinks. Fresh taste and nutrition are just a few minutes away with the HealthSmart Juice Extractor.  PRODUCT USES & UNIQUE FEATURES Part of a Healthy Lifestyle Did you know that eating fruits and vegetables are an important part of a healthy lifestyle? According to studies by the USDA, eating more fruits and vegetables reduces your risk of chronic diseases like heart attacks and strokes, some cancers, heart disease, obesity, and type 2 diabetes, in addition to acute ailments like kidney stones and high blood pressure. Finding the time and energy to shop and juice isn't always easy. With the HealthSmart Juice Extractor, kick-starting and maintaining a healthy lifestyle couldn't be simpler. Just one 6 to 10-oz. serving (175-300 ml) of juice fulfills the recommended daily value of Vitamin A and D, calcium, potassium, protein \u2013 plus fiber. All without the need for extra sugar, preservatives or additives.  PRODUCT FEATURE BENEFITS Makes healthy, fresh-tasting fruit and vegetable juicesProcesses hearty fruits and vegetables, including apples, carrots and celeryDesigned for easy assembly, handling, operating and storage Powerful 400-watt motorStainless steel cutter/strainer juices produce quickly Juice spout funnels juice directly into a variety of glass and container sizesRemovable plastic parts are dishwasher safe Variety is Key The HealthSmart Juice Extractor offers healthy recipes and tips for adding more vegetables to your diet and \"smart shopping\" for the flavor and the season. Try out one of these healthy, delicious recipes today:  THE GO-GETTER 4 medium kale leaves2 medium carrots, trimmed1 cup baby spinach leaves1 Granny Smith apple, quartered1/2 lemon, peeled1-inch piece fresh ginger, peeled Juice all ingredients in order listed.

SPICY VEGGIE DELIGHT 2 broccoli flowerets with stalk1/4 green pepper1 carrot1 celery stalk1 tomatoHot pepper sauce to taste Juice all ingredients in order listed. Stir well and serve. Makes 1 serving.  FRUIT UTOPIA 2 bananas, peeled1/2 cup blueberries3 rings of pineapple2 apples1 lemon, peeled Juice all ingredients in order listed. Stir well and serve. Makes 1 serving.  Alternative Uses  Not sure what to do with the leftover pulp? The leftover pulp is mostly fiber and cellulose, which like the juice, contains necessary vital nutrients for the daily diet. Any leftover pulp can be used in a variety of recipes, frothy drinks, casseroles or soups, as well as for garden composting.  Thirsty for something other than juice? The HealthSmart Juice Extractor can help children, teens and adults get their daily vitamin intake with the option of making soy, almond or rice milk. To start, soak one cup of soybeans, almonds or rice in four cups of water for 24 to 48 hours in the refrigerator, and then slowly pour one cup into the food chute. The liquid extracted from the soaked mixture is the \"milk.\" For enhanced milk flavor, consider adding vanilla or honey.  Easy Cleanup All plastic parts (except for the motor base) remove for easy cleanup in the dishwasher. To clean the cutter/strainer, run water over the strainer basket and brush off excess fiber buildup or pulp. The pulp bin container can be emptied by turning the extractor OFF and removing it from the unit. For easy cleanup, place a plastic grocery bag in the pulp bin container to collect the pulp and once juicing is complete, simply discard.  TIPS & CARE  The proportion of pulp to juice varies from fruit to fruit. Juicing avocados or bananas produces a puree rather than a juice. Form leafy vegetables into compact balls or rolls before inserting into food chute. All fruits with pits and large seeds, such as nectarines, peaches, apricots, plums and cherries must be pitted before juicing. Also, it is recommended that oranges, pineapples, melons and mangoes be peeled before placing in the unit to minimize impact on juice flavor. When juicing carrots, do not pack the food chute or allow pulp container to overfill, since this may prevent correct operation or damage to the unit. Place carrots in food chute one by one, and press down gently with food pusher to extract the maximum amount of juice every time. Be prepared to rinse individual parts after each use.

However, along with the air, liquids are also vacuumed out of the bag, leading to partial or failed seals. The VP210 Chamber Machine uses different technology to eliminate this problem. When sealing with our chamber machine, the vacuum bag to be sealed is placed inside the chamber of the machine, and the lid is closed. Then air is sucked out of the entire chamber, not just the bag, allowing the air pressure on the inside and outside of the bag to remain equal and liquids to stay in the bag. The bag is then sealed, and the air let back into the chamber. In addition, the chamber machine can reach a higher level of vacuum.

We can't stand the status quo\u2014especially when the status quo stinks. That was literally true back in 1982, when you had two options for getting garlic into your meal: chop up a fresh clove and have your hands smell for the rest of the day, or settle for a couple of thin, dry flakes tapped out of a plastic container. For our founder, CEO, and Famous Inventor David Holcomb, there really was no option. He had to do better, and he knew he could. Fast forward a few decades and David's first creation, the Garlic Machine, has become Chef'n. We're a growing Seattle-based company with more than 250 product patents worldwide and a single mission. We want to make better tools so you can make better food. It's what drives our in-house design team to reinvent the utensils and gadgets that most of us take for granted while we're cooking and cleaning. It's what attracts the terrific, talented people we've welcomed into our Chef'n family. And it's what compels us to tell everyone we meet about the innovation Chef'n products can bring to their kitchens. Is anyone listening? Well, the design awards and magazine covers seem to say yes, but for us the true test is in the homes of real people around the world. So put one of our inventions to work, create something delicious, and we look forward to hearing from you about your Chef'n experience.

Competitors Storing herbs seems simple but unless you properly store your herbs they will only last a few days. Herbs are sold in bundles and for most recipes a bundle is too much. What happens to the leftovers? If they are not used right away most of what was bought is thrown out.  Cuisipro Herb Keeper's unique suspended tray system makes it easy to store and access herbs. Other herb keepers tend to be overcomplicated to use or drip water all over the place when gathering herbs.  The Cuisipro Herb Keeper comes in 2 convenient sizes so you can choose the one right for you; large one that handles multiple bunches of herbs and compact size for a single herb bundle. How to Use Cuisipro's Herb Keeper: Lift knob to remove tray and fill Herb Keeper with water up to fill linePlace tray in container and rest on interior supportsPlace herbs in tray and immerse base, keeping leaves above waterStore herbs in fridge and change water regularlyWhen needed, suspend tray on supports to pick herbs  Features Large Container: The size of the herb keeper is large enough to accommodate bulk herbs. Simply place herbs in tray and drop herb stems in water. Your leftover herbs will last for weeks. Two simple parts make this quick and easy. Some competitor's containers are too small and have several parts. If the container is not a good size then you are still wasting the herbs if you are unable to store all in the container. One keeper on the market has several parts, it requires placing herbs in a tray, putting two halves of the container together and yet another step of placing the container in a holder. As simple task that has suddenly become complicated. Suspended/Removable Tray: The tray suspends at midpoint of unit to load or take out herbs. The tray holds herb bunches together for easy access with no need to take the tray out of the container. The tray has holes so the water hydrates the herbs. Suspend the tray and holes are there for drainage making the Cuisipro herb keeper mess free.  No other herb keeper has a suspended tray that makes it easy to access herbs. The removable feature is also unique to refill with water or simply refresh water. There is no need to unscrew from the bottom to refill as other herb keepers do. This is difficult when your hands are wet and you need to juggle the herbs to keep them in the container. Other units require you to take container out of water then open to access herbs, dripping water as you collect more herbs.  Perfect Amount of Herbs: Both can be used for all types of herbs and also asparagus. The large size herb keeper is 9.5 inch/24 cm with 4.75 inch/12 cm diameter and large enough to hold large amount or multiple packs of grocery store or farmers market sized bunches of herbs. The Compact Herb Keeper is 8.75 inch/22 cm with 3.75 inch/9.5 cm per side and perfect size for a single grocery store pack of herbs. Compact Herb Keeper holds half as much as the Larger Herb Keeper. Quick and Easy: With two simple parts you simply place herbs in tray and drop herb stems in water. Your leftover herbs will last for weeks. Some competitor's containers are too small and have several parts. If the container is not a good size then you are still wasting the herbs if you are unable to store all in the container.

Commercial mills remove 30 percent of the wheat kernel, removing the most nutritious part of the grain to make white flour. Milling your own flour not only ensures that your flour is as nutritious as it can be, it has a wonderful taste that is lost to commercially made whole-grain flour. NutriMill is the world's most popular maker of grain mills, and the NutriMill Classic has been its #1 selling mill for over 10 years! The NutriMill Classic electric grain mill uses a high speed impact chamber (also called a micronizer) with stainless steel milling heads to create flour from grains and beans. The NutriMill Classic has raised the bar for grain mill design with new features and abilities users have asked for\u2014a combination of features found in no other impact mill.  The new design of the NutriMill Classic's impact chamber allows you to put grain into the hopper before you turn it on with no risk of plugging the mill, which can happen with older mill designs. Even if stopped during grinding, the NutriMill Classic restarts again without trouble. With the Nutrimill Classic you have the ability to grind from super fine, much finer than any other impact mill, to coarser flour you need for perfect corn bread. Its impact grain milling heads provide a 400% range of adjustment from fine to coarse, ten times greater than earlier impact mills.  The NutriMill Classic allows you to grind up to 20 cups of flour at one time! Its grain hopper and flour bin are perfectly matched so you never have to worry about an overfilled mess. Convenient, powerful & fast: Just pour grain in the hopper, turn the NutriMill Classic on, and its powerful 10 amp, 1-3/4 hp motor does the rest, quickly producing your choice of fine, medium or coarse flour. The NutriMill Classic's impact grinding mechanism is self cleaning, and it operates dust-free, so grinding grain won't mean extra housecleaning later. Its one piece design, easy-grip handles, and light weight make the NutriMill Classic easy to move. The versatile NutriMill Classic grinds wheat (both hard and soft), oat groats (dehulled oats), rice, triticale, kamut, spelt, dry beans, lentils, dent (field) corn, popcorn, dried sweet corn, split peas, buckwheat, barley, rye, millet, teff, quinoa, amaranth, sorghum, dried mung beans and soybeans. It will also grind dried, minimally-sprouted grain. The NutriMill Classic isn't suitable for herbs, spices, oilseeds like flax, chopped chestnuts or fibrous materials. Also note that when set for coarser meal texture, the NutriMill Classic's output remains too fine for making cereal grinds. The Nutrimill Classic is an outstanding machine for making a full range of flour and meal textures.

The nominal filtration rating of the pre-filter layer is 50 microns, and the rating of the post-filter layer is 5 microns. The filter is made of spun polypropylene fibers for resistance to chemicals and bacteria. It has an initial pressure drop of less than 1 pound per square inch (psi) at a flow rate of 10 gallons per minute (gpm), and operates over a temperature range of 40 to 145 degrees F (4.4 to 62.8 degrees C).

They are made of densely packed synthetic or natural fibers that trap suspended particles, materials that block microbes or adsorb unwanted chemicals, or substances that cause a chemical change, such as acid neutralization. For most residential, commercial, and industrial applications, water filters are manufactured in the form of replaceable cartridges that fit inside permanent housings. Filtration systems typically consist of a series of two or more types of filters, each designed to remove different contaminants. The performance of filters is measured by the minimum particle size that is blocked, the percentage of particles or microorganisms that are removed, the downstream concentration of unwanted chemicals, the maximum flow rate, and the amount of water that can be filtered before the filter must be replaced. Water filters are used in a wide range of applications, including drinking water purification, swimming pools, industrial processes, and irrigation, among others.Pentair manufactures industrial, commercial, and residential water filtration components and systems.

Making fresh-brewed coffee in smaller amounts allows for a more enjoyable, aromatic and flavorful brew. No more stale or burnt coffee that was made hours ahead. Brew only what\u2019s needed for less waste. The pour-over coffee method is a time-tested technique, developed in Japan, that allows complete control over the quality and flavor of brewed coffee, one delicious cup at a time. Pour-over coffee, also known as hand pour, is a method of brewing coffee by pouring a thin, slow, steady stream of water over the ground coffee. Practiced by coffee lovers worldwide for the distinct, flavorful results, it requires water at a precise temperature, fresh, high-quality beans at the right grind, slow and even water flow, and patience during the brew time. HIC's Filter Cone is how to make good coffee the pour-over coffee way. For a perfect brew, preheat the Coffee Filter Cone by rinsing it with hot water, then place it over a mug or carafe. Insert a paper or reusable coffee filter and measure in medium-grind coffee, or grind whole beans fresh (approximately 2 rounded tablespoons of ground coffee per 8-ounces of water, or to desired taste). Using just-boiled water, wet all of the grounds slightly and let wet grounds stand to bloom coffee for 15 to 30 seconds. When grounds mix with water, they expand slightly and release more flavor. Slow and precise water flow is critical to extracting the most flavor with this pour over coffee technique. Pour the remaining hot water, slowly and evenly, from the center of the grounds outward, in a circular motion. Allow the porcelain coffee dripper to finish dripping. Total brew time should take about 2 \u00bd minutes. Remove the coffee filter cone from the mug and discard the wet grounds. Drink the fresh-brewed coffee immediately. HIC's Porcelain Filter Cone makes a perfect coffee accessories gift for at-home baristas and coffee enthusiasts. Made from high-fired porcelain with a scratch-free glaze that's durable.

Styled after the classic Japanese cook's knife, the Santoku has broad blade and especially sharp cutting edge as well as a Granton edge with indentations that minimize friction and sticking. It's a great companion for mincing, slicing, and dicing a variety of ingredients. Made in Solingen, Germany, the high-carbon stainless steel blade is made from a hot-drop forging process where the metal grain pattern is realigned and is transformed to a stronger material. Forged blades are typically thicker and heavier than stamped blades, and it has a steel bolster at the beginning of the handle and a tang that runs through the handle's center. A special tempering process is used to produce an edge that can be resharpened over and over again, so the knife can keep its original sharpness throughout the entire life of the blade.  Approved by the National Sanitation Foundation (NSF), the synthetic fibrox handle is ergonomically designed to minimize wrist tension, and it features a finger guard for a better grip. Hand washing is recommended, as the heat and the agitation of a dishwasher is not good for the edge of the blades and detergents can cause spots. The handle will also discolor with constant use of the dishwasher. This knife is backed by a limited lifetime warranty against manufacturers defects.  From the Manufacturer   Who is Victorinox? Although Victorinox is known the world over as the creator of the Original Swiss Army Knife, the company started out in 1884 as a cutlery workshop. By the time company creator Karl Elsener delivered his first pocket knife to the Swiss Army, his cutlery business was already booming. Over the next century, Victorinox cutlery became a top-rated choice among professionals worldwide, with over 300 blades to offer.  Victorinox knives have regularly appeared as highly ranked and recommended kitchen tools in Cook\u2019s Illustrated, Men\u2019s Health, The Cincinnati Enquirer, New York Magazine, and Natural Health, just to name a few. In 2009, the company announced a partnership with professional chef, Daniel Humm, of Eleven Madison Park in New York City. In addition, building on the success of its cutlery business, Victorinox has brought all the same quality and expertise to a wider range of products and accessories, including other kitchen tools, pocket tools, watches, luggage, and clothing.  Who is R.H. Forschner? Victorinox had been a staple in European commercial cutlery for over 50 years when approached by New York\u2019s R.H. Forschner, known since 1855 as a builder of scales for butchers, to be their sole cutlery supplier. The two companies joined forces in 1937, and R.H. Forschner subsequently became North America\u2019s dominant professional brand, as ubiquitous in the bustling meatpacking plants of the Midwest as it is in the gleaming, four-star restaurant kitchens of Midtown Manhattan.  As a division of Victorinox/Swiss Army Brands, R.H. Forschner marketed cutlery under the brand name \u201cRH Forschner by Victorinox\u201d and distributed to the commercial, food service, and retail trade classes. That brand has been considered a top choice of professionals worldwide with over 300 styles of blades bearing the R.H. Forschner name. However, in 2009, in conjunction with Victorinox\u2019s 125th anniversary, the company, Victorinox Swiss Army, Inc., has decided to remove the \u201cRH Forschner\u201d name from all blades. Blades thenceforth only include the \u201cVictorinox\u201d name.  What is a stamped blade? A stamped knife can usually be identified by the absence of a bolster. Stamped blades are cut into their shapes from cold-rolled pieces of steel and then ground, tempered, and sharpened. Creating them requires many less steps than forging and results in lighter, narrower blades. Some professionals prefer the thicker, heavier forged blades, but many pros, who spend much of their day cutting and slicing, enjoy a lighter knife since it\u2019s less fatiguing and easier to manipulate at speed.  Stamped knives are easier to produce and therefore less expensive. They perform very well and can approach the quality of a forged blade, but not the weight or feel. Victorinox manufactures a complete range of stamped blades with unique, patented Fibrox handles and they are considered among the greatest values in the knife industry.  What knives do I need to own? Knife choice or selection is determined by many factors--size, function, style, and preference. The most important factor is function. Different knives have different uses. It is important to use the proper knife for a specific task, since proper knife selection and the use of a proper-sized, sharp knife make for safe cutting. General kitchen tasks and the knife to use for them are as follows:  Paring: The most common to own and use, a paring knife is generally for small cutting jobs and peeling of vegetables or fruit. The blade size is usually from three to four inches. Choose the shape and size to fit your hand. Since this is one of the more versatile knives, owning more than one is recommended.  Chef's: The most important tool and essential to every cook, a chef\u2018s knife is most often used in a rocking method to mince, dice, and chop vegetables and herbs. This one is known as the chef\u2019s best friend.  Slicer: Most commonly used to slice meats, poultry, and seafood, the slicer is an important companion to any host or hostess.  Boning: As its name suggests, a boning knife is used to trim or remove meat and fish from the bone.  Bread: Designed with a special edge, a bread knife makes easy work of cutting through crusty bread, pastries, or any item with a crust and a soft interior.  Fillet: Most often used by pros and seasoned home chefs, the fillet knife is used to fillet meat and fish.  Cleaver: An important addition to any collection, a cleaver is often used to cut or chop through bones.  Santoku: This knife combines the features of a cleaver with a chef's knife. The curved blade helps the rocking motion used for chopping, and the wide blade works well for scooping sliced food off a cutting board and for crushing garlic. The santoku can also be used to slice meat and has a narrow spine for making thin cuts.  Utility: An all-purpose knife often referred to as a sandwich knife, the utility knife peels and slices fruits and vegetables, and even carves small meats.  Shaping: With its curved blade, a shaping knife is great for small precision cuts where control is essential, such as peeling, trimming, or garnishing.  What are the different knife edges and what do they do? Straight: The vast majority of Victorinox knives come with a straight or fine edge. This means it has a perfect taper along the blade and no serrations. It is designed to cut without tearing or shredding.  Serrated: An edge designed with small, jagged teeth along the edge.  Scalloped: A blade with waves along the edge generally used to cut breads with a hard crust and soft interior, as well as tougher-skinned fruits and vegetables.  Granton: This edge has hollowed-out grooves or dimples on the sides of the blade. These grooves fill with the fat and juices of the product being cut, allowing for thin, even cuts without tearing. Even with the grooves, these are still straight-edge knives and can be honed with a sharpening steel.  How should I care for my cutlery?  After use, knives should not be allowed to soak in water. The best practice is to hand wash and dry them immediately. This is especially true if they have been used on fruit or salty foods, which may cause some staining, even on stainless steel. Most knives require very little maintenance and it is worth the effort to protect your investment.  Though Victorinox knives are dishwasher safe, this is strongly discouraged. The dishwasher\u2019s agitation may cause damage. Additionally, harsh detergents can be harmful and cause pitting and spotting on the blades. The handles may also discolor and develop a white film with constant use of the dishwasher. Plus, intense heat associated with dishwashers is not good for the temper of the blade.  How do I keep my knives sharp? All quality knives require proper maintenance to keep them in perfect cutting shape. The best of edges will quickly dull if it strikes metal, glass, or Formica. A wooden cutting board makes the best cutting surface. And, if a slip occurs, a proper cutting board is safer for the user. Frequent use of a Victorinox sharpening steel will keep blades in tip top working condition. All straight-edge knives need steeling to keep their edges.   How to \"Steel\" a Knife 1. Hold the steel firmly in your left hand with the guard positioned to stop the blade should it slip. 2. Hold the knife in your right hand and place on top part of steel as shown. 3. Raise back of blade one-eighth inch. 4. Now, moving the blade only, draw it across the steel in an arching curve, pivoted at your wrist. The blade tip should leave the steel about two-thirds of the way down. 5. Repeat the same action with the Blade on the bottom side of the steel. Always maintain the same pressure and angle on both sides of the steel. 6. Repeat five or six times.  When a sharpening steel no longer does the job, it\u2019s time to take the knife to a qualified knife sharpener who will place a new edge on it. This, along with use of the sharpening steel, will give you many years of sharp, safe blades.  Please note that electric knife sharpeners can be harmful. They have to be used carefully as they remove too much metal, can harm the temper of the blade, and most important can change the factory-applied edge angle.  How should I store my knives?  Safety is the biggest concern of storage, both to the user and to protect the knife's edge. Choices include a knife magnet, knife block, drawer insets, and also individual knife protectors.", "salesrank_2018": "721059"}, "B001XCWNNG": {"description": "A great choice for culinary professionals as well as discerning home cooks, this limited edition 8-inch chef's knife celebrates Victorinox's 125th anniversary with special Jubilee Etching on the blade.

The best practice is to hand wash and dry them immediately. This is especially true if they have been used on fruit or salty foods, which may cause some staining, even on stainless steel. Most knives require very little maintenance and it is worth the effort to protect your investment.  Though Victorinox knives are dishwasher safe, this is strongly discouraged. The dishwasher\u2019s agitation may cause damage. Additionally, harsh detergents can be harmful and cause pitting and spotting on the blades. The handles may also discolor and develop a white film with constant use of the dishwasher. Plus, intense heat associated with dishwashers is not good for the temper of the blade.  How do I keep my knives sharp? All quality knives require proper maintenance to keep them in perfect cutting shape. The best of edges will quickly dull if it strikes metal, glass, or Formica. A wooden cutting board makes the best cutting surface. And, if a slip occurs, a proper cutting board is safer for the user. Frequent use of a Victorinox sharpening steel will keep blades in tip top working condition. All straight-edge knives need steeling to keep their edges.   How to \"Steel\" a Knife 1. Hold the steel firmly in your left hand with the guard positioned to stop the blade should it slip. 2. Hold the knife in your right hand and place on top part of steel as shown. 3. Raise back of blade one-eighth inch. 4. Now, moving the blade only, draw it across the steel in an arching curve, pivoted at your wrist. The blade tip should leave the steel about two-thirds of the way down. 5. Repeat the same action with the Blade on the bottom side of the steel. Always maintain the same pressure and angle on both sides of the steel. 6. Repeat five or six times.  When a sharpening steel no longer does the job, it\u2019s time to take the knife to a qualified knife sharpener who will place a new edge on it. This, along with use of the sharpening steel, will give you many years of sharp, safe blades.  Please note that electric knife sharpeners can be harmful. They have to be used carefully as they remove too much metal, can harm the temper of the blade, and most important can change the factory-applied edge angle.  How should I store my knives?  Safety is the biggest concern of storage, both to the user and to protect the knife's edge. Choices include a knife magnet, knife block, drawer insets, and also individual knife protectors.", "salesrank_2018": "702654"}, "B001XCWNNQ": {"description": "For 125-Year Victorinox cutlery has been an expression of the Victorinox philosophy: flawless quality combined with great reliability.

Airmuscle technology combines three components \u2013 a powered cam, a pneumatic actuator and a high-torque clutch \u2013 to precisely adjust the cleaner head to clean every floor type thoroughly. DC28 Animal also comes with a Flat Out head for cleaning under low furniture, and a Mini turbine head to remove dirt and pet hair from carpets, upholstery and tight spaces. With Root Cyclone technology, DC28 Animal doesn\u2019t lose suction power as you clean. There are no bags to replace and the filter is washable, so there are no extra costs.  Dyson Airmuscle Technology Patented Dyson Technology: Dyson engineers are constantly testing and inventing, trying to find new ways to make their technology work better. As they work, they file patent applications to protect their inventions from copycat manufacturers. That\u2019s why the only place you\u2019ll find Dyson technology is inside a Dyson machine.  Airmuscle Technology Dyson engineers spent three years developing Airmuscle technology. It combines three cleaner head technologies, which each precisely adjust to clean every floor type thoroughly. A pneumatic actuator pulls the cleaner head deeper into the carpet, removing embedded dirt and pet hair. The powered cam adjusts the brush bar while the cleaner head seals to the floor, focusing suction. And the high torque clutch delivers more power to the brush bar \u2013 opening the carpet pile to dislodge dirt. Root Cyclone Technology for No Loss of Suction  Ordinary vacuum cleaners rely on bags to trap dust and dirt. As you use them, the tiny holes in the bag clog up with particles of dust. This restricts the flow of air, so the vacuum cleaner loses suction. Dyson vacuum cleaners don\u2019t rely on bags to trap dust and dirt. They use patented Root Cyclone technology, which spins the air at incredibly high speeds. The cyclones inside a Dyson vacuum cleaner generate centrifugal forces many thousands of times the force of gravity. Dust, dirt and pet hair are flung out of the airflow and straight into the bin. No bag. No loss of suction.    DC28 Animal Product Features:      Fingertip floor selector The fingertip controls automatically adjust (or de-activate) the brush bar for different floor types using a powered cam. No bending down. No awkward dials.     Quick-draw Telescope Reach wand Single-action wand with instant 17 ft reach, for stairs and high-reach cleaning. No awkward parts to assemble.    No extra costs  Other vacuum cleaners are still designed to need replacement bags, belts and filters. Dyson vacuum cleaners don\u2019t need bags and have washable filters, so there are no extra costs..    Root Cyclone technology Dyson cyclones capture microscopic particles down to 0.5 microns in size, with no loss of suction.    Washable HEPA filter Captures allergens, expels cleaner air. Traps microscopic particles down to 1/5,000 of a pinhead. Particles this small include common household allergens such as pollen, mold spores and dust mites.    Certified asthma and allergy friendly DC28 Animal is certified asthma and allergy friendly by the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America.    Clear bin and hygienic emptying The bin on a Dyson vacuum cleaner is transparent so you can see when it needs emptying \u2013 and just how much dust, dirt and pet hair your new Dyson machine has picked up. It\u2019s made of tough polycarbonate and can be emptied with the push of a button \u2013 minimizing the risk of contact with dirt.   Airmuscle technology Three Dyson-engineered technologies adjust for the most thorough clean.    5 year parts and labor warranty  Your Dyson vacuum cleaner is likely to take a few knocks and bashes during everyday use \u2013 but that\u2019s nothing compared to what Dyson puts its machines through during testing and development.

Nonstick coating for any kitchen task  Cuisinart's GreenGourmet cookware is designed with an exclusive Cuisinart Ceramica nonstick surface, which features a petroleum-free, ceramic-based coating that is applied at a temperature one half that of traditional nonsticks. The coating does not contain PTFE and PFOA, substances often used in nonstick cookware that have raised health concerns over the years. It was also developed using manufacturing techniques that reduce harmful carbon emissions by consuming less energy. The coating is also water-based, unlike other nonstick coatings on the market, which are solvent-based. In addition, Cuisinart's cookware has a scratch-resistant nonstick surface that won't peel off.

For keeping blades in prime working condition, a sharpening steel is included. Kitchen shears round out the set, and a handy, attractive hardwood block neatly stores every piece. Each knife features high-carbon, stainless-steel blades, hand finished at Victorinox in Switzerland by skilled craftsmen. A special tempering process is used to produce an edge that can be resharpened over and over again, so every knife can keep its original sharpness throughout the entire life of the blade. In addition, full tang construction provides strength and balance. The black Fibrox handles feature a non-slip, ergonomic design to minimize wrist tension, and they are approved by the National Sanitation Foundation.

Constructed of the finest materials available to perfectly perform all of the classic cooking techniques, Cuisinart GreenGourmet Hard-Anodized cookware continues a long tradition of excellence. Today, more and more home cooks are going green\u2026 and so is Cuisinart cookware!  Nonstick coating for any kitchen task  Cuisinart's GreenGourmet cookware is designed with an exclusive Cuisinart Ceramica nonstick surface, which features a petroleum-free, ceramic-based coating that is applied at a temperature one half that of traditional nonsticks. The coating does not contain PTFE and PFOA, substances often used in nonstick cookware that have raised health concerns over the years. It was also developed using manufacturing techniques that reduce harmful carbon emissions by consuming less energy. The coating is also water-based, unlike other nonstick coatings on the market, which are solvent-based. In addition, Cuisinart's cookware has a scratch-resistant nonstick surface that won't peel off. The new cookware conforms to FDA and European RoHS standards for environmentally sound products. These pans should be hand-washed with a mild detergent. Cuisinart also gets some green cred from the packaging, which is made from 100 percent recycled materials and is printed using 100 percent biodegradable soy ink.  The pans deliver superior heat conductivity, requiring less energy to achieve the desired cooking temperature.
