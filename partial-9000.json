Each blade from the stamped line of cutlery is expertly made in Switzerland from high-carbon stainless steel and undergoes a special tempering process for an edge that can be resharpened again and again. The result is a knife that can keep its original sharpness throughout the entire life of the blade. Each blade is conical ground throughout its length and depth, which results in a wider break point with less risk of the blade breaking and less resistance for easier cutting, and then laser tested to ensure optimum cutting power and durability. The blades are paired with classic, beautiful rosewood handles riveted for durability and designed to minimize wrist tension while offering a comfortable grip. The Victorinox stamped collection with rosewood handles is an extensive range with open-stock pieces as well as handy and versatile sets.  Make sure everyone enjoys their steak with this smooth-cutting set of six steak knives from Victorinox, packaged in a handsome gift box that's great for storing for special occasions. The 4-3/4-inch straight-edge blades have a pointed tip and ergonomically designed, triple-riveted rosewood handles. Victorinox recommends washing the knives by hand even though they're dishwasher-safe, and covers the set with a lifetime warranty against defects.  From the Manufacturer   Who is Victorinox? Although Victorinox is known the world over as the creator of the Original Swiss Army Knife, the company started out in 1884 as a cutlery workshop. By the time company creator Karl Elsener delivered his first pocket knife to the Swiss Army, his cutlery business was already booming. Over the next century, Victorinox cutlery became a top-rated choice among professionals worldwide, with over 300 blades to offer.  Victorinox knives have regularly appeared as highly ranked and recommended kitchen tools in Cook\u2019s Illustrated, Men\u2019s Health, The Cincinnati Enquirer, New York Magazine, and Natural Health, just to name a few. In 2009, the company announced a partnership with professional chef, Daniel Humm, of Eleven Madison Park in New York City. In addition, building on the success of its cutlery business, Victorinox has brought all the same quality and expertise to a wider range of products and accessories, including other kitchen tools, pocket tools, watches, luggage, and clothing.  Who is R.H. Forschner? Victorinox had been a staple in European commercial cutlery for over 50 years when approached by New York\u2019s R.H. Forschner, known since 1855 as a builder of scales for butchers, to be their sole cutlery supplier. The two companies joined forces in 1937, and R.H. Forschner subsequently became North America\u2019s dominant professional brand, as ubiquitous in the bustling meatpacking plants of the Midwest as it is in the gleaming, four-star restaurant kitchens of Midtown Manhattan.  As a division of Victorinox/Swiss Army Brands, R.H. Forschner marketed cutlery under the brand name \u201cRH Forschner by Victorinox\u201d and distributed to the commercial, food service, and retail trade classes. That brand has been considered a top choice of professionals worldwide with over 300 styles of blades bearing the R.H. Forschner name. However, in 2009, in conjunction with Victorinox\u2019s 125th anniversary, the company, Victorinox Swiss Army, Inc., has decided to remove the \u201cRH Forschner\u201d name from all blades. Blades thenceforth only include the \u201cVictorinox\u201d name.  What is a stamped blade? A stamped knife can usually be identified by the absence of a bolster. Stamped blades are cut into their shapes from cold-rolled pieces of steel and then ground, tempered, and sharpened. Creating them requires many less steps than forging and results in lighter, narrower blades. Some professionals prefer the thicker, heavier forged blades, but many pros, who spend much of their day cutting and slicing, enjoy a lighter knife since it\u2019s less fatiguing and easier to manipulate at speed.  Stamped knives are easier to produce and therefore less expensive. They perform very well and can approach the quality of a forged blade, but not the weight or feel. Victorinox manufactures a complete range of stamped blades with classic, beautiful Rosewood handles and they are considered among the greatest values in the knife industry.  What knives do I need to own? Knife choice or selection is determined by many factors--size, function, style, and preference. The most important factor is function. Different knives have different uses. It is important to use the proper knife for a specific task, since proper knife selection and the use of a proper-sized, sharp knife make for safe cutting. General kitchen tasks and the knife to use for them are as follows:  Paring: The most common to own and use, a paring knife is generally for small cutting jobs and peeling of vegetables or fruit. The blade size is usually from three to four inches. Choose the shape and size to fit your hand. Since this is one of the more versatile knives, owning more than one is recommended.  Chef's: The most important tool and essential to every cook, a chef\u2018s knife is most often used in a rocking method to mince, dice, and chop vegetables and herbs. This one is known as the chef\u2019s best friend.  Slicer: Most commonly used to slice meats, poultry, and seafood, the slicer is an important companion to any host or hostess.  Boning: As its name suggests, a boning knife is used to trim or remove meat and fish from the bone.  Bread: Designed with a special edge, a bread knife makes easy work of cutting through crusty bread, pastries, or any item with a crust and a soft interior.  Fillet: Most often used by pros and seasoned home chefs, the fillet knife is used to fillet meat and fish.  Cleaver: An important addition to any collection, a cleaver is often used to cut or chop through bones.  Santoku: This knife combines the features of a cleaver with a chef's knife. The curved blade helps the rocking motion used for chopping, and the wide blade works well for scooping sliced food off a cutting board and for crushing garlic. The santoku can also be used to slice meat and has a narrow spine for making thin cuts.  Utility: An all-purpose knife often referred to as a sandwich knife, the utility knife peels and slices fruits and vegetables, and even carves small meats.  Shaping: With its curved blade, a shaping knife is great for small precision cuts where control is essential, such as peeling, trimming, or garnishing.  What are the different knife edges and what do they do? Straight: The vast majority of Victorinox knives come with a straight or fine edge. This means it has a perfect taper along the blade and no serrations. It is designed to cut without tearing or shredding.  Serrated: An edge designed with small, jagged teeth along the edge.  Scalloped: A blade with waves along the edge generally used to cut breads with a hard crust and soft interior, as well as tougher-skinned fruits and vegetables.  Granton: This edge has hollowed-out grooves or dimples on the sides of the blade. These grooves fill with the fat and juices of the product being cut, allowing for thin, even cuts without tearing. Even with the grooves, these are still straight-edge knives and can be honed with a sharpening steel.  How should I care for my cutlery?  After use, knives should not be allowed to soak in water. The best practice is to hand wash and dry them immediately. This is especially true if they have been used on fruit or salty foods, which may cause some staining, even on stainless steel. Most knives require very little maintenance and it is worth the effort to protect your investment.  Though Victorinox knives are dishwasher safe, this is strongly discouraged. The dishwasher\u2019s agitation may cause damage. Additionally, harsh detergents can be harmful and cause pitting and spotting on the blades. The handles may also discolor and develop a white film with constant use of the dishwasher. Plus, intense heat associated with dishwashers is not good for the temper of the blade.  How do I keep my knives sharp? All quality knives require proper maintenance to keep them in perfect cutting shape. The best of edges will quickly dull if it strikes metal, glass, or Formica. A wooden cutting board makes the best cutting surface. And, if a slip occurs, a proper cutting board is safer for the user. Frequent use of a Victorinox sharpening steel will keep blades in tip top working condition. All straight-edge knives need steeling to keep their edges.   How to \"Steel\" a Knife 1. Hold the steel firmly in your left hand with the guard positioned to stop the blade should it slip. 2. Hold the knife in your right hand and place on top part of steel as shown. 3. Raise back of blade one-eighth inch. 4. Now, moving the blade only, draw it across the steel in an arching curve, pivoted at your wrist. The blade tip should leave the steel about two-thirds of the way down. 5. Repeat the same action with the Blade on the bottom side of the steel. Always maintain the same pressure and angle on both sides of the steel. 6. Repeat five or six times.  When a sharpening steel no longer does the job, it\u2019s time to take the knife to a qualified knife sharpener who will place a new edge on it. This, along with use of the sharpening steel, will give you many years of sharp, safe blades.  Please note that electric knife sharpeners can be harmful. They have to be used carefully as they remove too much metal, can harm the temper of the blade, and most important can change the factory-applied edge angle.  How should I store my knives?  Safety is the biggest concern of storage, both to the user and to protect the knife's edge. Choices include a knife magnet, knife block, drawer insets, and also individual knife protectors.", "salesrank_2018": "32779"}, "B000PLUIIS": {"description": "The 4-inch Dumpling press is perfect for making pot stickers, international turnovers and dumplings for appetizers, hors d\u2019oeuvres, desserts and light snacks.

In fact, the materials are also certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (Slate, Natural, and RC100 only), and they are National Safety Foundation (NSF) approved (Slate and Natural only), which ensures an easy-to-clean nonporous design that will not harbor bacteria.  Compressed layers of nonporous wood fiber and food-safe resin form a high-quality food-prep surface. The wood-based cutting surface provides a natural look and texture, and it comes in a variety of different earth-toned colors. Each color depends on the combination of fiber sources, which are layered together and pressed along with a food-safe resin to form a highly functional food-prep surface. Over time, the color of the material will develop a richer, more enhanced hue. Knife Friendly Unlike other surfaces, cutting on the wood-based cutting surface won't dull kitchen knives. The surface will score slightly to help protect the knife's edge, which means less need for re-sharpening knife blades. Daily Convenience The cutting surface offers a low-profile design that slips neatly into vertical or horizontal cupboards for space-saving storage between uses. The cutting surface might be best left out on the counter--whether tucked behind the cookie jar or under the basket of fruit--for quick, everyday access. Both sides of the unit work equally well for food preparation--the board can also be used as a serving tray when offering cheese and crackers or other hors d'oeuvres to guests at a party. Furthermore, the board can be used as a trivet on a dining table or buffet to prevent pots and pans for damaging surfaces. The unit can withstand heat up to 350 degrees F (176 degrees C), but it should not be used in the microwave or used as cookware in the oven. Use and Care The cutting surface offers a durable design that can stand up to the rigorous daily use of any busy kitchen. It resists staining and cracking and offers maintenance-free convenience--no need to oil or bleach. Though stain-resistant, the cutting surface may stain if left in contact with a highly alkaline product or food for a prolonged amount of time. Liver, papaya, and red beets, for example, may leave a mark. To remove stubborn stains, try a non-abrasive household cleaner. Made in the USA, the cutting surface can be cleaned in the dishwasher (unlike wood and bamboo cutting boards) or by hand in the sink with hot soapy water. As with any wood product, be sure to dry the cutting surface completely and store upright when not in use to avoid warping.

The Breville BJE510 Juice Fountain Multi-Speed with variable speeds is a smart juicer that adjusts speed to extract the maximum juice with minimal waste. A built-in smart chip increases power to the cutting disc under heavy loads so juicing is accomplished as efficiently as possible. Juicing Versatility and Power Fruit is largely composed of water, but its selling point is its nutritional value. How do you extract the juice from fruit, without leaving the nutrients behind? Breville\u2019s Nutri Disc and patented juicing system extracts more nutrients than other juicers and transfers less than 1.8F of heat to protect enzymes and maximize nutrient absorption of select nutrients. The 900 watt motor has speeds ranging from 6500 rpm for softer fruits and leafy greens like cantaloupe or spinach to 12500 rpm for maximum extraction from denser foods like apples or beets. A smart chip allows the juicer to sense the load and adjust power accordingly, making juicing more efficient. The uniquely designed juicing system features an extra-wide feed chute that is centered over the shredding disc. This allows for more efficient juicing than systems that introduce ingredients on the side of the shredding disc. The 3\" chute eliminates the need to pre-chop ingredients before feeding them into the juicer, saving you time.   Nutri Disc with titanium-reinforced blades shreds both hard and soft fruits and vegetables with ease The 900 watt, high-grade 5 speed motor features a built-in electronic smart chip that increases power to the cutting disc under heavy loads. As a result, the filter extracts more juice and can make an 8 oz. glass in just 5 seconds.

The width of the blade, which is slightly wider than a standard utility knife, offers added heft needed for larger tasks, while the shorter blade length allows for better maneuverability than an 8\" chef\u2019s knife, especially when performing more precise cutting tasks. The result is an extremely versatile knife that is equally suited for skinning a pineapple or watermelon, dicing onions, mincing shallots, chopping herbs, cubing fruit, or slicing meats of many varieties. The razor sharp blade slices through veggies and meat like butter, so don\u2019t be surprised if you find yourself reaching for this knife every time you\u2019re cooking.   Each knife is incredibly sharp, featuring a tapered knife edge that is ground in two directions to hold a sharp edge longer, and can easily be brought back to its original sharpness. The overall shape of the blade, with the signature long, sloping curve chef\u2019s knives are known for, lends itself to \u201crocking\u201d very well, allowing one to mince and chop with ease. Comfortable even after extended use in the kitchen, the 5\" Fibrox Pro Chef\u2019s Knife is optimally weighted with high-quality, lightweight European steel that reduces hand and wrist fatigue, making it feel less like a knife and more like an extension of the hand.   The ergonomic, non-slip patented Fibrox Pro handle provides a comfortable grip no matter the size of your hand or where you are gripping the handle. Designed to minimize wrist tension while providing a secure grip, the Fibrox Pro handle is both lightweight and durable. Offering perfect balance, the textured handle feels secure even when greasy or wet, leaving you feeling in control to make precise and effortless cuts every time.   For all of these reasons, Fibrox Pro cutlery has been the choice of culinary professionals for decades, and also due in part to the fact that it is hygienic and dishwasher safe. The National Sanitary Foundation (NSF) certifies that this product is made to the highest sanitary standards, so you can cut with confidence.   Whether a seasoned, or novice home chef, Victorinox Swiss Army offers not only the right tools and the know-how, but most importantly, the confidence to achieve one\u2019s culinary aspirations.   Expertly crafted in Switzerland since 1884, Victorinox offers a lifetime guarantee against defects in material and workmanship.   Please NOTE that this item ships with the International item number 5.2003.12 on the blade and not 47552 or 40552, but is the same 5\" Fibrox Pro Chef's Knife. The only difference is how the knife is packaged. This knife is packaged in a clamshell package.   Formerly Forschner In 1937 Victorinox began selling cutlery in America through a Connecticut distributor called R.H. Forschner & Co. A well-known manufacturer of butcher scales, Forschner soon became the exclusive U.S. distributor for Victorinox knives, and was the name by which Victorinox knives were known.   In 2011 Victorinox began marketing all its product lines, including kitchen knives, under the common umbrella name by which the company is now popularly known \u2013 Victorinox Swiss Army.   Care and Use Be good to your knives and they\u2019ll be good to you. Following these simple guidelines will ensure that you get the longest life out of your knife!   Hand Washing Victorinox Swiss Army recommends washing all knives by hand. For best results, hand wash your knives with a soapy cloth and dry immediately.   Dishwasher While Fibrox Pro knives are dishwasher safe, we recommend hand washing as dishwashers are designed to spray water at a relatively high pressure, which can jostle the silverware and cause the knives to collide, dulling the edge.   Maintaining your Knife\u2019s Edge For optimum performance, knives should be honed after every couple of uses. Proper and frequent honing will keep your knives sharper and performing at their best, but remember that a honing steel will not sharpen a dull knife. Honing steels are maintenance tools and are used to help keep an already sharp blade from degrading. During use, a knife edge becomes rolled or turned from direct contact with cutting boards, bones or other hard objects. In this case, honing is necessary to straighten the edge of the knife. After significant use, the steel particles become damaged and the edge cannot be brought back by honing, so sharpening is necessary. If your knives are dull, pitted, or you see visible nicks on the cutting edge, you\u2019ll need to sharpen with a Swiss Sharp Handheld Sharpener (49002) or bring to a professional for re-sharpening.   History and Heritage In 1884, Master Cutler Karl Elsener opened a cutlery shop in Ibach, Switzerland. There, he and the cutlers\u2019 union he formed produced the finest steel cutlery, finished with the now-famous proprietary edge preferred globally by professional and home cooks. In 1891, Karl supplied the Swiss Army with its standard issue Soldier\u2019s Knife and in 1897 with the Officer\u2019s Knife. In 1921, after the death of his mother, Victoria, and with the advent of stainless steel, then known as \u201cinoxydable\u201d and used in the production of his cutlery, Karl changed the name of the company to Victorinox. It is from those humble beginnings that a worldwide icon was born.   Today, Victorinox is still owned and operated by the Elsener family, and both the company and family still resides in the small village of Ibach, Switzerland.", "salesrank_2018": "9308"}, "B000QCMFYG": {"description": "Hungry for some warm chocolate chip cookies?

The straight-edge of this knife allows for smooth, clean cuts and the pointed tip allows you to easily pierce meat. The tapered knife edge is ground in two directions to hold its edge longer, and can easily be brought back to original sharpness. The blade is also more flexible than other knives to allow for enhanced maneuverability around bones. Flexible boning knives are best suited for thinner, more intricate cuts of meat that can be easily pierced, such as fish, while stiff boning knives are best suited for tougher meats that require more heft.   The ergonomic, non-slip patented Fibrox Pro handle provides a comfortable grip no matter the size of your hand or where you are gripping the handle. Designed to minimize wrist tension while providing a secure grip, the Fibrox Pro handle is both lightweight and durable, making these knives seem less likes tools and more like an extension of your hand. The textured handle feels secure even when greasy or wet, allowing for precise and effortless cuts every time.   For all of these reasons, Fibrox Pro cutlery has been the choice of culinary professionals for decades, and also due in part to the fact that it is hygienic and dishwasher safe. The National Sanitary Foundation (NSF) certifies that this product is made to the highest sanitary standards, so you can cut with confidence.   Whether a seasoned, or novice home chef, Victorinox Swiss Army offers not only the right tools and the know-how, but most importantly, the confidence to achieve one\u2019s culinary aspirations. Expertly crafted in Switzerland since 1884, Victorinox offers a lifetime guarantee against defects in material and workmanship.

Formerly Forschner In 1937 Victorinox began selling cutlery in America through a Connecticut distributor called R.H. Forschner & Co. A well-known manufacturer of butcher scales, Forschner soon became the exclusive U.S. distributor for Victorinox knives, and was the name by which Victorinox knives were known.   In 2011 Victorinox began marketing all its product lines, including kitchen knives, under the common umbrella name by which the company is now popularly known \u2013 Victorinox Swiss Army. Today, Victorinox Swiss Army still sells a handful of accessories, including the High Heat Turner line, under the Forschner name.   Care and Use Be good to your knives and they\u2019ll be good to you. Following these simple guidelines will ensure that you get the longest life out of your knife!   Hand Washing Victorinox Swiss Army recommends washing all knives by hand. For best results, hand wash your knives with a soapy cloth and dry immediately.   Dishwasher While Fibrox Pro knives are dishwasher safe, we recommend hand washing as dishwashers are designed to spray water at a relatively high pressure, which can jostle the silverware and cause the knives to collide, dulling the edge.   Maintaining your Knife\u2019s Edge For optimum performance, knives should be honed after every couple of uses. Proper and frequent use of a honing steel will keep your knives sharper and performing at their best, but remember that a honing steel will not sharpen a dull knife. Honing steels are maintenance tools and are used to help keep an already sharp blade from degrading. During use, a knife edge becomes rolled or turned from direct contact with cutting boards, bones or other hard objects. In this case, honing is necessary to straighten the edge of the knife. After significant use, the steel particles become damaged and the edge cannot be brought back by honing, so sharpening is necessary. If your knives are dull, pitted, or you see visible nicks on the cutting edge, you\u2019ll need to sharpen with a Swiss Sharp Handheld Sharpener (49002) or bring to a professional for re-sharpening.   History and Heritage In 1884, Master Cutler Karl Elsener opened a cutlery shop in Ibach, Switzerland. There, he and the cutlers\u2019 union he formed produced the finest steel cutlery, finished with the now-famous proprietary edge preferred globally by professional and home cooks. In 1891, Karl supplied the Swiss Army with its standard issue Soldier\u2019s Knife and in 1897 with the Officer\u2019s Knife. In 1921, after the death of his mother, Victoria, and with the advent of stainless steel, then known as \u201cinoxydable\" and used in the production of his cutlery, Karl changed the name of the company to Victorinox. It is from those humble beginnings that a worldwide icon was born.   Today, Victorinox is still owned and operated by the Elsener family, and both the company and family still resides in the small village of Ibach, Switzerland.", "salesrank_2018": "9952"}, "B000QCPNUE": {"description": "The R H Forschner by Victorinox Paring Knife Set includes: 3.25-inch Straight Edge Parer, 2.25-inch Bird's Beak Parer and 3.25-inch Wavy Edge Parer.

A special tempering process is used to produce an edge that can be resharpened over and over again, so the knife can keep its original sharpness throughout the entire life of the blade.

Santoku translates to \"\"three virtues\"\" or \"\"three uses\"\" which refers to the three types of cuts this knife is made for: slicing, dicing, and mincing. It combines features of both a chef's knife and a cleaver. The wide blade is perfect for scooping sliced or chopped ingredients off the cutting board and transferring them into a pot or bowl. The triad of abilities this knife possesses makes it a must-have for every home chef.   Featuring a flat cutting edge and a rounded tip called a sheep's foot, the Fibrox Pro Santoku's unique shape makes it a stand-out from other kitchen knives. The flat edge doesn't rock on the cutting surface, which distinguishes it from a chef's knife, and provides a highly efficient motion for slicing, dicing, and mincing. The Granton blade, also referred to as a hollow or fluted edge, features hollowed-out grooves or dimples on both sides on the blade. Depending on what is being cut, these grooves will fill with juices or create pockets of air, which prevents food from sticking to the blade and creates less friction to allow for easier motion when chopping.   Even with the grooves, these are still straight-edge knives and can be honed with a sharpening steel, so they can remain razor sharp at all times. The tapered knife edge is ground in two directions to hold a sharp edge longer, and can easily be brought back to its original sharpness.

A quality mill with a specifically designed grinding mechanism will release the aromas and essential oils of that spice. Freshly ground pepper and spices have more aroma and better flavor than pre- ground. Another advantage of using freshly ground spices or minerals (salts) is the control a mill provides for determining the coarseness (size) of a grind. A high quality pepper, salt or spice mill gives you the ability to choose and change the coarseness according to taste or necessity.  How to Choose a Good Mill When looking for a pepper, salt or spice grinder, consider the following: Grinding mechanism: Choose a grinding mechanism that can withstand daily use: one that is well made and produces a consistent grind. Ideally, the grinding mechanism should be designed to handle a specific spice, as each spice has different physical characteristics that will benefit from different design features.  Design and appearance: Whether it's traditional or modern, manual or electric, a mill can be an indispensable tool in your kitchen and a beautiful part of table d\ufffdcor.  Ease of Use: A quality mill should be easy to adjust, easy to fill, and feel comfortable in the hand.  History of Peugeot Peugeot's story starts in the 19th century when the Peugeot brothers converted the family's gristmill into a steel foundry. They began producing award winning hand tools immediately after opening and went on to produce a diverse range of exceptional quality products including small appliances, bicycles and most notably, automobiles. (Although now operating as a separate company, the Peugeot car company continues the same commitment to quality and innovation that is a Peugeot hallmark). In 1840 Peugeot created their burr style coffee grinder and adopted that design to accommodate peppercorns in 1874. The resulting pepper mechanism design is still used today in every Peugeot pepper mill. Peugeot's iconic pepper grinding mechanism design is often copied, but never equaled. Today, Peugeot offers six unique spice-specific mechanisms plus the original burr-style coffee grinder. There are no shortcuts: each mechanism is designed to get the most out of the spices they are intended for. After more than 160 years, Peugeot mills and grinders remain the benchmark of the industry and have earned their position as the mill of choice in world class kitchens. It's All About the Mechanism  The primary difference between Peugeot and all other brands are the spice-specific mechanisms. Peugeot has 7 unique spice specific mechanisms for pepper, salt, herbs and spices, coffee, wet salt, chili peppers and nutmeg. For each spice, there is one - and only one - Peugeot grinding mechanism, each made of the ideal design and constructed from the best material available for its intended use. All Peugeot mechanisms are made in France and carry a lifetime limited warranty.    Peugeot's Pepper Grinding Mechanism is a two stage burr-style system. During production, the helix-shaped grooves and grinding teeth of the pepper mechanism are individually cut before the steel is case hardened to make it virtually indestructible. The mechanism is then given a proprietary treatment to provide additional protection against corrosion. During use, the helix- shaped grooves guide whole peppercorns through the mechanism to crack, then grind to a consistent size by a double row of teeth. This process releases the pepper's essential oils, resulting in more flavor and aroma for your dish. This patented mechanism is found on every Peugeot Pepper mill and is widely considered the best pepper mechanism available      Peugeot's Salt Crushing Mechanism features two ribbed plates which work to fracture and crush coarse, dry sea salt to a consistent size. The salt grinding mechanism is made of corrosion resistant Stainless Steel, and is found on every Peugeot Salt Mill.       A Peugeot Innovation u'Select is Peugeot's patented grind control system for electric and manual grinders. Beyond personal preferences, different stages of the preparation / cooking process and different dishes often call for seasonings of varying sizes. Peugeot now offers the ability to quickly, easily and accurately adjust the grind settings with its patented u'Select system.   From coarsely ground pepper or salt to very fine, u'Select offers: -6 pre-defined levels of grind for pepper, or any point in between. -6 pre-defined levels of grind for salt, or any point in between. Simplicity: just turn the ring at the base of the mill and select your grind size. The further you turn the ring, the finer or coarser the grind, depending on the direction turned. Precision: no risk that the grind will change during use.  The right grind: You are assured that with each setting, the grind will be consistent, time after time.     Fine or coarse grind-is it just a question of taste? Actually it depends on personal taste and the dish being prepared. While personal taste plays a role, some dishes call for coarse salt or pepper, whereas others require either or both to be finely ground. A finer grind will be used for a delicate sauce or mixed raw vegetables and a coarse grind for grilling a steak or when making heartier meats and dishes.    Anatomy of u'Select Mills These mills feature the innovative u'Select system. u'Select mills have the same renowned grinding mechanisms, beauty and functionality as classic Peugeot mills with an additional feature of easy grind selection. When you want to adjust the grind of your salt/pepper to more coarse or fine, you simply turn the u'Select ring at the base of the mill. You can select one of six pre-marked positions, or any point in between, for infinite possibilities. Your selection will not move or change until you want it to.    Manual MillsFor best grinding results: hold the mill body steady and turn mill top in a clockwise direction only    Electric Mills Press the Power switch to grind pepper or salt. Light will illuminate underneath mill when power switch is pressed. u'Select Ring:The narrower the wedge, the finer the grind.   Which pepper and which salt can be used in Peugeot Mills? Pepper:  To get the best results, we recommend you to use only dry, hard, whole peppercorns that are 5 mm (1/4\") or less in diameter. Black, white and dry green peppercorns can be ground in Peugeot pepper mills. Pink peppercorns can be ground only if in a blend (max 15% pink) with one of these other peppercorns. Dried coriander seeds are also suitable for the pepper mechanism.  Salt:  To get the best out of your Peugeot salt grinding mechanism, you should use: dry salt, ideally with a diameter of 4 mm (0.16\") such as coarse sea salt or rock salt (salt mined from an underground salt seam). Do not use your Peugeot salt mill for grinding pepper or any other spice, or damp sea salt (also known as grey salt, Guerande, Re, etc.) The moisture content is so high in damp salt that it will corrode the mill. Use a Peugeot Wet Salt mill with a mechanism specifically designed for damp salt. Its shape and materials have been designed to resist salt corrosion.

Pepper:  To get the best results, we recommend you to use only dry, hard, whole peppercorns that are 5 mm (1/4\") or less in diameter. Black, white and dry green peppercorns can be ground in Peugeot pepper mills. Pink peppercorns can be ground only if in a blend (max 15% pink) with one of these other peppercorns. Dried coriander seeds are also suitable for the pepper mechanism.  Salt:  To get the best out of your Peugeot salt grinding mechanism, you should use: dry salt, ideally with a diameter of 4 mm (0.16\") such as coarse sea salt or rock salt (salt mined from an underground salt seam). Do not use your Peugeot salt mill for grinding pepper or any other spice, or damp sea salt (also known as grey salt, Guerande, Re, etc.) The moisture content is so high in damp salt that it will corrode the mill. Use a Peugeot Wet Salt mill with a mechanism specifically designed for damp salt. Its shape and materials have been designed to resist salt corrosion.    ", "salesrank_2018": "134297"}, "B000RAC7X6": {"description": "  Advantage of Freshly Ground Spices  There are many benefits to freshly grinding pepper, salt, herbs and spices for cooking and seasoning. A quality mill with a specifically designed grinding mechanism will release the aromas and essential oils of that spice. Freshly ground pepper and spices have more aroma and better flavor than pre- ground. Another advantage of using freshly ground spices or minerals (salts) is the control a mill provides for determining the coarseness (size) of a grind. A high quality pepper, salt or spice mill gives you the ability to choose and change the coarseness according to taste or necessity.  How to Choose a Good Mill When looking for a pepper, salt or spice grinder, consider the following: Grinding mechanism: Choose a grinding mechanism that can withstand daily use: one that is well made and produces a consistent grind. Ideally, the grinding mechanism should be designed to handle a specific spice, as each spice has different physical characteristics that will benefit from different design features.  Design and appearance: Whether it's traditional or modern, manual or electric, a mill can be an indispensable tool in your kitchen and a beautiful part of table d\ufffdcor.  Ease of Use: A quality mill should be easy to adjust, easy to fill, and feel comfortable in the hand.  History of Peugeot Peugeot's story starts in the 19th century when the Peugeot brothers converted the family's gristmill into a steel foundry. They began producing award winning hand tools immediately after opening and went on to produce a diverse range of exceptional quality products including small appliances, bicycles and most notably, automobiles. (Although now operating as a separate company, the Peugeot car company continues the same commitment to quality and innovation that is a Peugeot hallmark). In 1840 Peugeot created their burr style coffee grinder and adopted that design to accommodate peppercorns in 1874. The resulting pepper mechanism design is still used today in every Peugeot pepper mill. Peugeot's iconic pepper grinding mechanism design is often copied, but never equaled. Today, Peugeot offers six unique spice-specific mechanisms plus the original burr-style coffee grinder. There are no shortcuts: each mechanism is designed to get the most out of the spices they are intended for. After more than 160 years, Peugeot mills and grinders remain the benchmark of the industry and have earned their position as the mill of choice in world class kitchens. It's All About the Mechanism  The primary difference between Peugeot and all other brands are the spice-specific mechanisms. Peugeot has 7 unique spice specific mechanisms for pepper, salt, herbs and spices, coffee, wet salt, chili peppers and nutmeg. For each spice, there is one - and only one - Peugeot grinding mechanism, each made of the ideal design and constructed from the best material available for its intended use. All Peugeot mechanisms are made in France and carry a lifetime limited warranty.    Peugeot's Pepper Grinding Mechanism is a two stage burr-style system. During production, the helix-shaped grooves and grinding teeth of the pepper mechanism are individually cut before the steel is case hardened to make it virtually indestructible. The mechanism is then given a proprietary treatment to provide additional protection against corrosion. During use, the helix- shaped grooves guide whole peppercorns through the mechanism to crack, then grind to a consistent size by a double row of teeth. This process releases the pepper's essential oils, resulting in more flavor and aroma for your dish. This patented mechanism is found on every Peugeot Pepper mill and is widely considered the best pepper mechanism available      Peugeot's Salt Crushing Mechanism features two ribbed plates which work to fracture and crush coarse, dry sea salt to a consistent size. The salt grinding mechanism is made of corrosion resistant Stainless Steel, and is found on every Peugeot Salt Mill.       A Peugeot Innovation u'Select is Peugeot's patented grind control system for electric and manual grinders. Beyond personal preferences, different stages of the preparation / cooking process and different dishes often call for seasonings of varying sizes. Peugeot now offers the ability to quickly, easily and accurately adjust the grind settings with its patented u'Select system.   From coarsely ground pepper or salt to very fine, u'Select offers: -6 pre-defined levels of grind for pepper, or any point in between. -6 pre-defined levels of grind for salt, or any point in between. Simplicity: just turn the ring at the base of the mill and select your grind size. The further you turn the ring, the finer or coarser the grind, depending on the direction turned. Precision: no risk that the grind will change during use.  The right grind: You are assured that with each setting, the grind will be consistent, time after time.     Fine or coarse grind-is it just a question of taste? Actually it depends on personal taste and the dish being prepared. While personal taste plays a role, some dishes call for coarse salt or pepper, whereas others require either or both to be finely ground. A finer grind will be used for a delicate sauce or mixed raw vegetables and a coarse grind for grilling a steak or when making heartier meats and dishes.    Anatomy of u'Select Mills These mills feature the innovative u'Select system. u'Select mills have the same renowned grinding mechanisms, beauty and functionality as classic Peugeot mills with an additional feature of easy grind selection. When you want to adjust the grind of your salt/pepper to more coarse or fine, you simply turn the u'Select ring at the base of the mill. You can select one of six pre-marked positions, or any point in between, for infinite possibilities. Your selection will not move or change until you want it to.    Manual MillsFor best grinding results: hold the mill body steady and turn mill top in a clockwise direction only    Electric Mills Press the Power switch to grind pepper or salt. Light will illuminate underneath mill when power switch is pressed. u'Select Ring:The narrower the wedge, the finer the grind.   Which pepper and which salt can be used in Peugeot Mills? Pepper:  To get the best results, we recommend you to use only dry, hard, whole peppercorns that are 5 mm (1/4\") or less in diameter. Black, white and dry green peppercorns can be ground in Peugeot pepper mills. Pink peppercorns can be ground only if in a blend (max 15% pink) with one of these other peppercorns. Dried coriander seeds are also suitable for the pepper mechanism.  Salt:  To get the best out of your Peugeot salt grinding mechanism, you should use: dry salt, ideally with a diameter of 4 mm (0.16\") such as coarse sea salt or rock salt (salt mined from an underground salt seam). Do not use your Peugeot salt mill for grinding pepper or any other spice, or damp sea salt (also known as grey salt, Guerande, Re, etc.) The moisture content is so high in damp salt that it will corrode the mill.

Designed to minimize wrist tension while providing a secure grip, the Fibrox Pro handle is both lightweight and durable, making these knives seem less likes tools and more like an extension of your hand. The textured handle feels secure even when greasy or wet, allowing for precise and effortless cuts each and every time.   For all of these reasons, Fibrox Pro cutlery has been the choice of culinary professionals for decades, and also due in part to the fact that it is hygienic and dishwasher safe. The National Sanitary Foundation (NSF) certifies that this product is made to the highest sanitary standards, so you can cut with confidence.   Whether a seasoned, or novice home chef, Victorinox Swiss Army offers not only the right tools and the know-how, but most importantly, the confidence to achieve one\u2019s culinary aspirations. Expertly crafted in Switzerland since 1884, Victorinox offers a lifetime guarantee against defects in material and workmanship.   Please NOTE that this item ships with the International item number 5.2533.21 on the blade and not 40549, 47549, or 47549.US2, but is the same 8\" Fibrox Pro Bread Knife.   Formerly Forschner In 1937 Victorinox began selling cutlery in America through a Connecticut distributor called R.H. Forschner & Co. A well-known manufacturer of butcher scales, Forschner soon became the exclusive U.S. distributor for Victorinox knives, and was the name by which Victorinox knives were known.   In 2011 Victorinox began marketing all its product lines, including kitchen knives, under the common umbrella name by which the company is now popularly known \u2013 Victorinox Swiss Army. Today, Victorinox Swiss Army still sells a handful of accessories, including the High Heat Turner line, under the Forschner name.   Care and Use Be good to your knives and they\u2019ll be good to you. Following these simple guidelines will ensure that you get the longest life out of your knife!   Hand Washing Victorinox Swiss Army recommends washing all knives by hand. For best results, hand wash your knives with a soapy cloth and dry immediately.   Dishwasher While Fibrox Pro knives are dishwasher safe, we recommend hand washing as dishwashers are designed to spray water at a relatively high pressure, which can jostle the silverware and cause the knives to collide, dulling the edge.   Maintaining your Knife\u2019s Edge For optimum performance, knives should be honed after every couple of uses. Proper and frequent use of a honing steel will keep your knives sharper and performing at their best, but remember that a honing steel will not sharpen a dull knife. Honing steels are maintenance tools and are used to help keep an already sharp blade from degrading. During use, a knife edge becomes rolled or turned from direct contact with cutting boards, bones or other hard objects. In this case, honing is necessary to straighten the edge of the knife. After significant use, the steel particles become damaged and the edge cannot be brought back by honing, so sharpening is necessary. If your knives are dull, pitted, or you see visible nicks on the cutting edge, you\u2019ll need to sharpen with a Swiss Sharp Handheld Sharpener (49002) or bring to a professional for re-sharpening.   History and Heritage In 1884, Master Cutler Karl Elsener opened a cutlery shop in Ibach, Switzerland. There, he and the cutlers\u2019 union he formed produced the finest steel cutlery, finished with the now-famous proprietary edge preferred globally by professional and home cooks. In 1891, Karl supplied the Swiss Army with its standard issue Soldier\u2019s Knife and in 1897 with the Officer\u2019s Knife. In 1921, after the death of his mother, Victoria, and with the advent of stainless steel, then known as \u201cinoxydable\" and used in the production of his cutlery, Karl changed the name of the company to Victorinox. It is from those humble beginnings that a worldwide icon was born.   Today, Victorinox is still owned and operated by the Elsener family, and both the company and family still resides in the small village of Ibach, Switzerland.", "salesrank_2018": "40598"}, "B000RMFIM6": {"description": "3755  Features: -Box fan with thermostat.-Patented fused safety plug.-Isolated Weather Shield motor for worry-free window use.-Adjustable built in thermostat automatically turns fan on or off as needed.-Wider body for greater floor stability.-Three whisper quiet speeds.-Ideal for nighttime use.-Easy-to-use controls located on the handle.-Energy-efficient operation.

Definition of Sateen: Sateen fabric has a supremely soft, satin-like finish resulting from a four-over-one thread weave. Standard weaves, like percale, use a one-over, one-under stitch. The four-over weave puts more threads nearer the surface, resulting in a softer, warmer surface. Sateen fabrics are most often made of mercerized cotton, but can be made of other fabrics, including cotton blends, polyester, and rayon. Mercerized threads give sateen fabrics a higher luster. Mercerization, named for process-creator John Mercer, involves treating threads with a cold concentrated sodium hydroxide solution. Mercerization also increases strength, dyeability, and resistance to mildew, as well as reduces lint. Sateens can be produced in light and heavy weights, and are ideal for bedding.", "salesrank_2018": "995747"}, "B000SOM6GO": {"description": "An Amazon Brand.", "salesrank_2018": "684220"}, "B000SOOHTS": {"description": "Genuine Hoover filter fits inside the dirt cup of S2200 and S2220 Hoover Stick Vacuums.

The KRUPS KM700552 Grind and Brew coffee maker embodies the mastery of the key components to the perfect cup of coffee: the grind, the coffee-to-water ratio, the brew temperature and contact time. Featuring a conical steel burr grinder recognized by coffee connoisseurs as the best method of preparing whole beans and 5 grind levels to allow adjustments from fine to coarse, the KRUPS Grind and Brew coffee maker takes the most out of coffee beans to deliver a full-bodied coffee. Its 3 levels of coffee strength: mild, medium and strong along with the aroma function for more intense extraction and the number of cups selection ensures a complete control on the brewing process. Control and convenience are at the heart of the KRUPS KM700552 Grind and Brew coffee machine. Programmable, the KRUPS coffee maker can be set to automatically brew, the warming plate then maintains the temperature in the carafe for up to 2 hours after which the machine shuts off automatically for safety and convenience. And for these who are in a hurry the pause and serve feature enables you to remove the carafe during the brew cycle and pour an early cup. With the KRUPS KM700552 Grind and Brew coffee machine prepare from 2 to 10-cups of intense coffee every morning for a unique experience each and every time.Troubleshooting Steps Coffee is very weak: \u00a0- Use more ground coffee (see \u201cThe ratio\u201d page 9) * when using the grinder : \u00a0 \u00a0. use medium or strong strength setting \u00a0 \u00a0. be sure the ground coffee supply channel is full before grinding and brewing - Try a darker roast bean. \u00a0\u00a0 Coffee brews too slowly\u00a0(more than 10 minutes): - Descale the machine (see \u201cDescaling\u201d page 13) - Clean the brew basket and drip stop valve of coffee residue. Also clean the permanent filter if applicable. - Check that there are no issues with the power supply. - Use a different quality coffee paper. - Check that any coffee bean is not clogging the tank bottom. \u00a0 Brew basket will not swivel closed: \u00a0- The filter holder must sit down into the brew basket, and the handle click into place. \u00a0- Use the handle to seat the filter holder then fold the handle down and press until it locks into place. \u00a0\u00a0 Problems with programming the Auto-on or the clock: \u00a0 - Turn the machine off and unplug it from the power source. Wait 1 minute and reconnect. This can allow the electronics to reinitialize to factory settings. \u00a0 The stop-drip does not work: - Clean the valve under running water, manually activating the stop-drip. \u00a0 The coffee-grinder is excessively noisy\u00a0(non-coffee objects in the grinding mechanism): - Make sure there is no stone, wood, etc. that may have been introduced through your supply of coffee-beans. - Check if, during following preparations, the noise persist. - Contact the Krups Service Center. The grinder is obstructed - Make sure there is no stone, wood, etc. that may have been introduced through your supply of coffee-beans. - Don\u2019t use caramelized or treated with additives sugar based, coffee beans. - Don\u2019t use too oily coffee beans.

The coffeemaker measures 10-2/3 by 8-4/9 by 16-1/4 inches and carries a three-year limited warranty.  From the Manufacturer   The Cuisinart DGB-700BC Fully Automatic Burr Grind & Brew Coffeemaker   The Cuisinart Burr Grind & Brew Coffeemaker  The first thing you'll notice about the new Fully Automatic Burr Grind & Brew is the quality of the coffee. A burr mill extracts maximum flavor from beans, and easy-to-use controls let you choose the strength of the brew. With the bigger bean hopper, fully programmability, and Cuisinart simple cleanup, it's never been easier to make a great pot of coffee. The Quest for a Perfect Espresso It is generally agreed that there are four basic elements critical to the perfect cup:     Element 1. Water:    Coffee is 98% water. Often overlooked, the quality of the water is as important as the quality of the coffee. A good rule of thumb is that if your water doesn't taste good from the tap, it won't taste any better in your coffee. That's why Cuisinart has added a water filter to the Fully Automatic Burr Grind & Brew Coffeemaker. The charcoal water filter removes chlorine, bad tastes and odors, for the purest cup of coffee every time.      Element 2. Coffee:    While the bulk of the liquid is water, all of the flavor should be from the coffee. To achieve the same great quality of coffee you receive at a coffee bar, you need to use the same quality beans. Buy the beans fresh and whole, only about a two weeks' supply at a time for maximum freshness. Once the coffee bean is broken, its flavor degrades very quickly. That's why the Fully Automatic Burr Grind & Brew Coffeemaker grinds your coffee just prior to brewing. If it is not practical to buy small supplies, we recommend you separate larger amounts of beans into one to two week portions immediately after purchase, and freeze them in airtight containers. The best way to maximize freshness is to minimize exposure to air, light and moisture. So, once beans have been removed from the freezer, maintain them in a sealed container at room temperature, since damaging condensation occurs every time the beans are removed from the freezer or refrigerator. Note that some coffee experts advise against freezing dark-roast beans, because freezing can cause the oils to coagulate. Other experts disagree. We suggest you experiment and decide yourself. We recommend keeping the hopper at least half way full. Be sure that you have sufficient amount of beans in your hopper for the amount of coffee you intend to brew. Although it is preferable to use fresh, whole beans, you can make coffee in the coffeemaker using pre-ground beans. To do so, turn off the grinder by pressing the Grind Off button before turning on the unit. It is suggested to use 1 level scoop of ground coffee per cup and adjust the amount to your taste. The maximum capacity for ground coffee is 16 level scoops, using either a paper or permanent filter. Exceeding this amount may cause overflow.      Element 3. Grind:     The grind of the coffee is critical for proper flavor extraction. If the grind is too fine, over extraction and bitterness will result. Too fine a grind may also clog the filter. If the grind is too coarse, the water will pass through too quickly and the desired flavors will not be extracted. The Fully Automatic Burr Grind & Brew Coffeemaker is preset for a medium grind, the optimal grind for this type of coffeemaker.      Element 4. Proportion:    The Fully Automatic Burr Grind & Brew Coffeemaker makes up to twelve cups of (54 ounces) of coffee.     Making Coffee with Whole Beans   12-cup glass caraffe    Fill the Water Reservoir:  Open the reservoir lid. Pour the desired amount of water in the reservoir using the water level window indicator. Close the reservoir lid. Note: Do not exceed the 12-cup line; doing so may cause the carafe to overflow.   Add Beans:  Lift the hopper lid, using the recess on either side. Fill the hopper with beans. It is recommended keeping the hopper at least halfway full. Be sure that you have a sufficient amount of beans in your hopper for the amount of coffee you intend to brew (maximum capacity is 1/2-pound. Do not over-pack the hopper. Over-packing may result in jamming the grinder.) For easy filling, the hopper container can be taken out by turning the hopper container release knob to the unlock position. Note: Do not put any water in the unit once the hopper container has been removed. If the water gets into the grinder motor, the motor may become damaged and may malfunction. Put hopper lid back in place.   Lock Hopper:  If you have removed the hopper from the unit, be sure that the hopper container release knob is in the unlocked position and place the hopper container back in the unit. Turn the knob to locked position. This unit is equipped with a safety interlock system. The unit will not operate grinding function if the hopper container is not in place. If you try to turn on the unit for grinding with the hopper out of place, the unit will beep continuously until the missing part is installed. The brewing process can be restarted by pressing the On button. Restarting the process will not affect coffee results.   Insert Coffee Filter:  Open filter door by pressing filter basket door release button. Remove filter basket cover and place a #4 basket paper filter or Cuisinart's commercial style permanent filter in the basket. The unit is equipped with a safety interlock system. The units will not operate if the filter basket cover or filter basket are not in place or if the filter door is not closed. If you try to turn the unit on while the filter compartment is out of place, the unit will beep continuously until the missing part(s) are installed.   Brewing:   Immediate Grinding and Brewing:   Turn the Grind Control Knob to select the number of cups you want to brew. The coffeemaker will grind the corresponding amounts of beans. The unit will automatically adjust for low cup settings.  Press the Strength Control button to set the coffee strength. MILD, MED or STRONG will show on the LCD display. Press the On button. The indicator will light and process will begin.    Programmed Brewing:  Press the Program button. The indicator will light and the display will show the programmed time for as long as the button is depressed. The display reverts back to the time of day once the button is released.  Turn the Grind Control knob to select the number of cups you want to brew. The Coffeemaker will grind the corresponding amount of beans. The unit will automatically adjust for low cup settings. Press the Strength Control button to set coffee strength. MILD, MED or STRONG will show on the LCD display. The coffeemaker will begin brewing at the programmed time.      During and After Brewing:  The Brew Pause feature allows you to remove the carafe from the heating plate during mid-brew. The brewing process does not stop during this period; only the flow of coffee from the basket stops. Do not remove the carafe for longer than 20 seconds or the coffee may overflow the basket. While Cuisinart offers this feature, it is not recommended that you pour coffee before the cycle has reached completion, since the coffee brewed at the beginning of the cycle has a flavor profile which is very different from the coffee made at the end of the cycle. Removing the cup during the brewing cycle will alter the flavor of the finished pot. When the brewing cycle is completed, five beeps will sound. Coffee will continue to stream from the filer for several seconds.   Making Coffee with Pre-Ground Beans   Simple operation control panel    Fill the Water Reservoir:  Open the reservoir lid. Pour the desired amount of water in the reservoir using the water level window indicator. Close the reservoir lid. Note: Do not exceed the 12 cup line; doing so may cause the carafe to overflow.   Add Coffee Grounds:  Open filter door. Add ground coffee to the permanent or #4 paper filter.  Place filter basket lid in place and close filter door.    Brewing:   Immediate Grinding and Brewing:   Press the Grind Off button. When this function is activated, an amber LED will be illuminated.  Press the On button.

The coffee bean is the fundamental ingredient that needs to be brewed to make coffee. The difference between decent coffee and great coffee is the bean's type of roast and when the bean was ground. Every time you buy fresh coffee beans and ask the checkout person at the coffee shop to grind your beans you are opening up the \"flavor cells\" and causing your beans to begin losing their flavor rapidly. The purpose of grinding the beans is to create a larger surface area that will release the flavor and oils to the surrounding hot water. If coffee is prematurely exposed to air, it \"breathes\", leaving less and less flavor for the brew, when the water finally hits the bean. It only takes a few moments to grind your own beans. The difference it makes will surprise you.  Burr grinders are said to be the best option for grinding coffee beans. Most Burr grinders include a compartment at the top of the grinder that holds the beans. This is an airtight compartment that will keep the beans fresh until you are ready to grind them. When you are ready to grind, simply select the amount of coffee you'd like to prepare and the Burr grinder will release that amount of beans to be ground.  Owning a coffee grinder and grinding coffee beans at your own home will give you the maximum experience of the true joy of coffee. Adding the Kitchenaid Pro Line Series KPCG100 Burr Coffee Mill is a dependable way to assure you're getting great coffee.

The unit offers a 1- to 4-cup setting for brewing a smaller amount without compromising flavor, and its brew-pause function allows for pouring a cup before the brew cycle has completed. The included 10-cup double-wall insulated thermal carafe comes with a generous stay-cool handle and a dripless pour spout for comfortable, drip-free serving. Providing added convenience, the coffeemaker automatically shuts off at the end of the brewing cycle, and its 60-second reset \"remembers\" where it was in the brewing process and settings. Accessories include a charcoal water filter, a gold-tone filter, and a user manual. With its classic design and stainless accents, the stylish coffeemaker measures approximately 8 by 9 by 13 inches and carries a three-year limited warranty.  From the Manufacturer   The Cuisinart DCC-1150 10-Cup Programmable Thermal Coffeemaker   Thermal Carafe For Hot Coffee in Any Room  You\u2019ll love the way the Cuisinart Classic 10-cup programmable coffeemaker looks on the counter, as its brewing 10-Cups of fabulous coffee. The Cuisinart Classis Thermal 10-cup programmable coffeemaker is a statement about how serious you are about your coffee \u2012 and your kitchen. Enjoy the full programmability, extreme ease of use, double-wall thermal carafe, and great tasting coffee. The Quest for a Perfect Cup of Coffee It is generally agreed that there are four basic elements critical to the perfect cup:  Element 1. Water: Coffee is 98% water. Often overlooked, the quality of the water is as important as the quality of the coffee. A good rule of thumb is that if your water doesn\u2019t taste good from the tap, it won\u2019t taste any better in your coffee. That\u2019s why Cuisinart has added a water filter to the Cuisinart Classic Thermal 10-cup programmable coffeemaker. The charcoal water filter removes chlorine, bad tastes and odors, for the purest cup of coffee every time.  Element 2. Coffee: While the bulk of the liquid is water, all of the flavor should be from the coffee. To achieve the same great quality of coffee you receive at a coffee bar, you need to use the same quality beans. Buy the beans fresh and whole, only about a two weeks\u2019 supply at a time for maximum freshness. Once the coffee bean is broken, its flavor degrades very quickly. If it is not practical to buy small supplies, we recommend you separate larger amounts of beans into one to two week portions immediately after purchase, and freeze them in airtight containers. The best way to maximize freshness is to minimize exposure to air, light and moisture. So, once removed from the freezer, beans should be maintained in a sealed container at room temperature, since damaging condensation occurs every time the beans are removed from the freezer or refrigerator. Note that some coffee experts advise against freezing dark-roast beans, because freezing can cause the oils to coagulate. Other experts disagree. We suggest you experiment and decide yourself.    The Perfect Cup of Coffee  Element 3. Grind:  The grind of the coffee is critical for proper flavor extraction. If the grind is too fine, over extraction and bitterness will result. Too fine a grind may also clog the filter. If the grind is too coarse, the water will pass through too quickly and the desired flavors will not be extracted. A medium-fine grind is recommended.  Element 4. Proportion: Add the amount of ground coffee that corresponds to the number of cups being brewed. Use 1 tablespoon of ground coffee per cup, but use more or less to suit your taste. Note: the maximum capacity for ground coffee is 15 tablespoons for the 10-Cup (5 ounce cups) coffeemaker. Exceeding this amount may cause overflow if the coffee is too finely ground.    Features and Benefits    DCC-1150 Base    LCD & Controls  Reservoir Cover: Flips back for easy filling. Water Reservoir: Open the cover by lifting it up. Pour the desired amount of water in the reservoir using step water level indicator located at the rear of the reservoir. Showerhead: Distributes water evenly over coffee, reducing temperature loss as water passes through grounds. Water Filter: Charcoal water filter eliminates chlorine, calcium and bad tastes or odors from tap water. Cuisinart recommends changing the water filter every 60 days or 60 uses \u2012 or more often if you have hard water. Filter Basket: Holds a #4 paper filter or a permanent filter. LCD Digital Clock: Displays the time of day and set time for automatic functions. Function Knob: Used to initiate programming of automatic functions \u2012 Auto On, Program, Clock and Brew. The Auto On feature is used to program the start time of the brew cycle. The Auto On can be set for any time, day or night. The PM indicator is displayed on the LCD for nighttime program times. Note: This coffeemaker shuts off automatically after brewing is complete. 1- to 4-Cup Setting: For brewing smaller pots of coffee. It provides double heating of the water, so coffee is piping hot. Clean Setting: Tells you when it\u2019s time to clean your coffeemaker. Remove built-up calcification from the water reservoir, to help extend the life of your coffeemaker. Brew Pause: Stops flow of coffee from basket when carafe is removed (30 seconds max) from the heater plate, so a cup can be poured in mid-brew. Since the flavor extraction rate varies during the brew cycle, we recommend allowing the brewing cycle to finish before pouring the coffee. The coffee brewed at the beginning of the cycle has a flavor profile which is very different from the flavor at the end of the cycle. Once the coffee has finished brewing, stir it before serving to blend the flavors. The coffee at the bottom of the carafe will be somewhat stronger than the coffee at the top. Thermal Carafe with Hands-Free Lid: The easy pour no drip, double wall insulated 10-cup stainless thermal carafe with an ergonomic handle. The brew-through, pour-through lid allows coffee to drip from the coffeemaker through the closed lid. When brewing is complete, the lid seals itself so air stays out and the coffee freshness and temperature are preserved. No need to turn or adjust the lid before pouring. Note: Use caution, the bottom of the thermal is hot to touch for several minutes after brewing. Heating Plate: Scratch resistant with black, nonstick coating. Ready Tone: Signals the end of the brew cycle with five beeps (coffee will continue to stream from the filter for a few seconds after the tone). Cord Storage Power Loss Back-up System: One-minute protection in case of power fails, breaker trips, or unit is unplugged. It holds all programmed information, including the time of day, auto on time and auto off time.

The powerful unit features innovative spinning side brushes that grab dirt and dust from corners and along wall edges, as well as two high-speed, counter-rotating brushes that pick up pet hair, cat litter, food crumbs, and other debris from floors. The vacuum sucks up the debris and deposits it into a large, easy-to-empty bagless dustbin, and its improved fine-filtration system traps dust, pollen, and other allergens inside the unit, reducing infiltration into the living environment. For added convenience, the vacuum's cleaning head automatically adjusts to transition from wood, tile, and linoleum to carpets and rugs, while improved anti-tangle technology ensures it won't get stuck on cords and rug fringe. If the unit begins to pick up a cord or carpet tassel, it will automatically reverse the direction of its brushes to extract the item. A gentle-touch bumper system senses obstacles so the vacuum automatically slows its approach, gently touches the obstacle, then redirects to continue cleaning under or around the object. Because it cleans under beds, couches, and other hard-to-reach areas, it actually vacuums more of the floor than a standard upright can. The vacuum also senses dirtier areas and spends more time cleaning them, and it uses built-in cliff sensors to avoid stairs and other drop-offs. In addition, invisible barriers can be set using the unit's Virtual Wall system. To mark off-limit areas, simply place a Virtual Wall at a doorway or other opening and adjust the infrared beam setting to the distance of the opening. The unit automatically detects the beam and will not cross it.  The vacuuming robot returns to its self-charging Home Base to dock and recharge between cleaning cycles or when the battery starts to run low. Its advanced power system consists of a fast-charging battery, a three-hour charger, and a power source that supercharges the unit for up to 120 minutes of continuous cleaning, covering about three to four average-size rooms on a single charge. Other accessories include two Virtual Walls (that require two D batteries each), a brush cleaning tool, and an extra filter. The vacuuming robot measures 16-3/4 by 21 by 5 inches and carries a one-year limited warranty. Yes, It Really Works This smart, powerful, and autonomous vacuum features iRobot\u2019s proven and patented three-stage cleaning system. First, innovative spinning side brushes grab dirt and debris from corners and along wall edges, then two high-speed, counter-rotating brushes pick up pet hair, food crumbs, and other debris. The powerful vacuum sucks up the debris and deposits it into a large, easy-to-empty bagless dustbin.  The improved fine-filtration system traps dust, pollen, and other allergens inside the robot, reducing infiltration into your living environment. The cleaning head automatically adjusts to transition from wood, tile, and linoleum to carpets and rugs. Improved anti-tangle technology ensures it won\u2019t get stuck on cords and rug fringe. If Roomba begins to pick up a cord or carpet tassel, it will automatically reverse the direction of its brushes to extract the item. Roomba senses dirtier areas and spends more time cleaning them, and it uses built-in cliff sensors to avoid stairs and other drop-offs. When the job is done, Roomba returns to its self-charging Home Base to dock and recharge between cleaning cycles or when the battery is running low.    Easy to Use  The Roomba 530 features a friendly and informative audio voice demonstration that walks you through initial setup and alerts you when Roomba requires maintenance or assistance. Starting a cleaning cycle is simple--just press the \"Clean\" button and Roomba does the rest. First it will calculate the size of the room, the obstacles in the room, and the cleanliness of the floors. Then it goes to work all by itself. At the end of each cleaning cycle, Roomba 530 returns to its Home Base to dock and recharge. Yes, it\u2019s that simple. Routine maintenance is a snap. The large-capacity bagless bin is easy to slide out, empty, and click back into place. The brushes and filters can be easily removed by hand for routine cleaning and maintenance.             Smart and Efficient Roomba calculates the appropriate cleaning time and pattern for each area and adjusts its behavior over 67 times per second to achieve the most thorough cleaning result. On average, Roomba covers every part of the floor four times. A gentle-touch bumper system senses obstacles, so Roomba automatically slows its approach, gently touches the obstacle, then redirects to continue cleaning under or around the object. Because it cleans under furniture, Roomba actually vacuums more of the floor than a standard upright can--and you don\u2019t even have to push it around. Roomba\u2019s Virtual Wall creates an invisible barrier that it will not cross (two Virtual Walls are included with the Roomba 530). To mark off-limit areas, simply place a Virtual Wall at a doorway or other opening and adjust the infrared beam setting to the distance of the opening. Roomba automatically detects the beam and will not cross it. The vacuum's advanced power system consists of a fast-charging battery, a three-hour charger, and a power source that supercharges the unit for up to 120 minutes of continuous cleaning, covering about three to four average-size rooms on a single charge. When the battery is low or when Roomba has completed a cleaning cycle, it automatically returns to the self-charging Home Base to dock and recharge. As a member of the newest generation of Roomba innovation, the Roomba 530 features a more powerful vacuum and redesigned high-speed, counter-rotating brushes that pick up more dirt, pet hair, dander, cat litter, crumbs, leaves, and other debris.  Features  A powerful vacuum: Two counter-rotating brushes and a powerful vacuum remove dirt, dust, pet hair, and other debris from your carpets and floors  Robot intelligence: Navigates throughout your home, cleaning under and around furniture, covering each area an average of four times   Avoids off-limit areas: 2 Virtual Walls tell Roomba where to clean by restricting off-limit areas   Self-charging and docking: Automatically returns to its Home Base to dock and recharge between cleanings  Detects dirt: Senses dirtier areas and spends more time cleaning them   Cleans beneath furniture: Cleans under tables, beds, chairs, and other hard-to-reach places  Edge-cleaning capability: Follows wall edges and reaches deep into corners to remove dust, dirt, and debris   Self-adjusting cleaning head: Automatically adjusts from carpets to hard floors and back again   Light-touch bumpers: Roomba slowly approaches obstacles, gently touches them, then redirects to clean around them   Anti-tangle system: Roomba effectively extracts itself if it picks up cords, carpet fringe, or tassels   Simple operation: Roomba keeps itself charged and ready to go--simply press the Clean button and Roomba does the rest   What\u2019s in the box: 1 iRobot Roomba 530, 2 Virtual Walls (require 2 D batteries each, not included), 1 self-charging Home Base, 1 power supply (3-hour charge time), 1 brush cleaning tool, 1 rechargeable battery, 1 extra filter    ", "salesrank_2018": "1152859"}, "B000UU9GCS": {"description": "LightAir IonFlow 50 delivers with an eye catching beauty probably the cleanest air in the world.

Any congestion can make breathing, feeding, and sleeping incredibly difficult for your little one.

The TCH130 is made of durable laboratory glass, it has a non-mercuric column and is engineered to give you the precise measurement accuracy necessary for successful chocolate tempering. Comes with a protective storage case. Chocolate tempering \u2014 melting and then cooling chocolate to a predetermined temperature \u2014is a necessary process for achieving professional quality chocolates in the home. When chocolate is melted and then cooled it can crystallize into several different forms. For the chocolate to set up with a nice sheen and to maintain firmness at room temperature the cocoa butter must form beta crystals. Tempering forces the correct crystalline pattern. Although chocolate that is simply melted and then re-hardened will probably taste as good, it will not have the glossy appearance or \u201csnap\u201d of tempered chocolate. It will look dull, and will not maintain a desirable texture. Also, untempered chocolate will be more likely to melt at room temperature. A. How to Temper Chocolate: Any chocolate you purchase will already be tempered when it leaves the factory. However, once it is melted for coating other items it will have lost its tempered properties. To regain the correct tempered property: 1. In a double boiler with barely simmering hot water, stir the chocolate with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon. Heat the chocolate to 120\u2013125\u00b0F. It helps to begin with small, uniform sized pieces of chocolate. 2. Remove the bowl from the heat and cool the melted chocolate to 86\u00b0F. Adding small pieces of already tempered chocolate can do this. 3. Raise the temperature of the chocolate by setting the bowl back over the pan of hot water for brief intervals (10\u201315 seconds). Keep an eye on the temperature. For white and milk chocolate, reheat to a maximum of 88\u00b0F, 90\u00b0F for dark chocolate. 4. The chocolate is now tempered and can be used for dipping or coating, but it must remain in the 86\u201390\u00b0F range. Continue passing it over the pan of hot water to maintain the proper temperature.Featuring advanced technology, quality construction, easy-to-read displays and user-friendly operations, CDN thermometers are essential tools in any kitchen.

Use it as a deep cleaner to remove the dirt from carpet that vacuums can\u2019t, or as a hard floor cleaner and water-filtrated vacuum. The advantages of 3 Stage Filtration  The Big Green Complete deep cleaner and canister vacuum has 3 stage filtration. This means the dirt, debris and air the vacuum suctions up goes through a sophisticated filtration process before releasing any air back into your home. The water filtration stage captures and sinks large particles, including dirt, hair and crumbs. Smaller particles are captured by the secondary filter, insuring that the vacuum captures all the dirt and dust you vacuum up. Finally, the HEPA Media Filter* cleans and filters the air passing through it.*The filter media, not the vacuum as a whole, complies with the IEST-RP-CC001.5 or the EN-1822-1:2009 HEPA standard.

Applied every three to four weeks, John Boos Mystery Oil prevents wood from drying, splitting, or cracking. The Mystery Oil is safe for food preparation surfaces and can also be used to maintain wood countertops and wooden kitchen tools. John Boos Wooden Cutting Boards More attractive and durable than plastic alternatives, wooden cutting boards also can inhibit bacteria growth and are easier on knives. Boos cutting boards are manufactured by John Boos & Co. in Effingham, Illinois, which has been manufacturing high-quality wood cutting boards, butcher blocks, and countertops since 1887.    John Boos & Company circa 1900. The History of John Boos & Co In business since 1887, John Boos & Co. is the oldest industry in South Central Illinois. Founder, Conrad Boos Sr. named the business after his son, John and for years, worked out of a blacksmith shop in Effingham. The blacksmith used a Sycamore tree placed on three legs to straighten horseshoes. The wooden block absorbed the shock of the hammer. In 1890, a local butcher realized the block could be used for cutting meat, and had one made. The word spread to surrounding small towns and cities and by 1911, John Boos was shipping from coast to coast.   In 1956, John Boos began to sell some of their products for home use. Today, John Boos cutting boards are found in hotels and restaurant kitchens, culinary schools, and on televised cooking shows. The old craftsmen work ethic is still around at John Boos, with a few changes.Premium Hard Rock Maple lumber from the surrounding Mid-West and Northern States is used in place of Sycamore lumber. And John Boos automation has replaced much of the older equipment with the exception of the 1942 block press which is very much in use today. John Boos & Co. utilizes 100% of their raw material to benefit the manufacturing processes. The smallest lumber scraps are transformed into sawdust and used to generate electricity and create steam to fuel the boilers.   The Early Years In 1892 the Boos family sold interest in the company to the Gravenhorst family. In 1895 the building burned and was rebuilt. In 1899 they moved to the present site of 315 South First Street for more space.  In 1920, they added extra buildings and kilns.. By the 1940s, butcher blocks were found in every restaurant, food store and butcher shop in America. Last Half of the Century Following WWII, the company added a dry kiln, increased its office space, and added manufacturing space. The shipping docks were enlarged while warehousing space and new products were added.    The company continued expanding through the 60s and '70s with the growth of its metal table market with synthetic tops, stainless-steel tops, or maple tops. Even though the government was tough on wood products through the 1970s and '80s, the company continued to grow with its new line of BDL store fixtures, park benches, and other butcher block furniture. Current Products & Markets The wood and metal products are listed with the National Sanitation Foundation, the leader in sanitation agencies for approving equipment to be installed in foodservice and supermarket operations. The products must have approval of various sanitation agencies in order to be accepted by the industry. John Boos & Co. Cucina butcher blocks and cutting boards are used by celebrity chefs throughout the USA, including Charlie Trotter, Ming Tsai, Paul Kahan, Susan Spicer, Mary Sue Milliken, and Susan Feninger. In addition, chef\u2019s featured on \"The Food Network\", such as Mario Batali and Emeril Lagasse, prepare meals every day on John Boos cutting boards. In 1994, we were we were 1 of 22 companies awarded the Gold Medal for Excellence in Foodservice Equipment by the Chefs of America at a ceremony conducted at Carnegie Hall in NYC. John Boos & Company Today The company currently occupies approximately 150,000 square feet in Effingham, IL and approximately 65,000 square feet in Philipsburg, PA and Suring, WI. The company\u2019s four dry kilns dry up to 210,000 board feet of lumber on a continual basis. Most of the hardwoods used for manufacturing are shipped from the Great Lakes, while the stainless steel comes from warehouses and distribution centers in Chicago, Indianapolis, and St. Louis.  Care and Maintenance Keeping Your Board Sanitized Wash your John Boos cutting board with hot soapy water after each use and dry it with a clean towel or let it air dry. For further sanitation, the board can be rinsed with a vinegar or chlorine bleach solution. (1 teaspoon bleach to one quart of water/5-to-1 ratio of vinegar to water) Do not soak the board in water--this will damage the wood. Wood cutting boards are NOT dishwasher-safe. Maintaining Your Board Oil your cutting board on all surfaces every 3-4 weeks. The Boos block cream finish with beeswax (included with the board) will protect and prolong the board\u2019s life. We recommend using John Boos Mystery Oil and/or Boos Block Cream with Beeswax. Research: Plastic vs. Wooden Cutting Boards Led by Dean O. Cliver, Ph.D, a research team compared plastic and wooden cutting boards to find out how to best disinfect wooden cutting boards from bacteria. They found that disease bacteria were not recoverable from both new and older knife-scarred wooden surfaces in a short time after they were applied, unless very large numbers were used. They found that while new plastic surfaces allowed the bacteria to persist, they were easily cleaned and disinfected. However, they found that older, knife-scarred plastic surfaces were impossible to clean and disinfect manually, especially when food residues such as chicken fat were present. Further, they found that if a sharp knife is used to cut into the work surfaces after used plastic or wood has been contaminated with bacteria and cleaned manually, more bacteria are recovered from the plastic surface than from the wood surface. The research team has no commercial relationships to John Boos or any other company making cutting boards. They believe, on the basis of their published and to-be-published research that food can be prepared safely on wooden cutting surfaces and that plastic cutting surfaces present some disadvantages. In conclusion, they believe their research shows evidence that wooden cutting boards are not a hazard to human health, but plastic cutting boards may be.

The ANTIGUA can be used to grind all kinds of roasts, from the oily espressos to lighter and dryer roasts. Moreover, the ANTIGUA is unlikely to clog up with remains of ground coffee provided that you empty the ground coffee container after each 40-second grinding cycle. The timer quantity/control allows for an amount of up to 2.8oz/80gr of coarse ground coffee and up to 1.4oz/40gr of fine ground coffee.

It is commonly used for detailed purposes such as brazing, plumbing, soldering, jewelry making, culinary, automotive and dental and lab applications. The GB2001 has a rubber, diamond-shaped, outer body finish, for safe grip and ease of use. It features a gas flow adjustment lever to allow for ease of flame heat and precision change.

It offers a long burn time, compared to some other Blazer micro torch products. The torch houses a piezoelectric ignition system, which is based on a pressurized molecular reaction, and requires no electric connection. Piezoelectric energy occurs when the trigger is activated, releasing a small, spring-loaded internal hammer that strikes a crystal, producing a spark and resulting in gas flame ignition. With a maximum flame temperature of 2,500 degrees F, the GB2001 has a continuous burn time of approximately 1.5 to 2.0 hours, at maximum fuel volume, and has a 26-gram gas capacity. The torch head has a 90-degree fixed angle, and its flame range is 0.5 to 1.25 inches. It has a safety component that offers manual lock of the ignition, when not in use.

Pancakes, eggs, bacon, casseroles, cakes and pies somehow taste better when cooked in heavy pre-seasoned cast-iron cookware. Cast iron creates superior heat retention, heats evenly, and loves a campfire, unlike flimsier pans. Great for preparing slow cooked meals, and perfect for searing meats that then can go directly into oven to finish cooking. Due to the great heat retention of cast iron, it will keep your food warm longer than any other cookware. Pre-seasoned out of the box saves you time and helps with easy cleanup. USE & CARE: Before first use, Pre-seasoned cast iron cookware should be washed in hot soapy water using a soft sponge or dishcloth. Pans should then be rinsed and dried. Do not allow your cookware to air dry or put away wet. Completely hand dry cookware before storing. Use mild liquid soap for this first preparation only. Before cooking, preheat the empty pan over medium heat for 1 \u2013 2 minutes: preheating prepares the surface and allows the food to cook more evenly without sticking. Repeat before each use. This product can be used on all cooking surfaces as well as in the oven but please make sure that you lift the cookware to move across glass or ceramic surfaces. The cover to your cast iron cookware is oven safe to 350\u00b0F and the cooking vessel is safe to 500\u00b0F. Do not use under a broiler or in a microwave oven. Always use hot pads to remove cookware from stovetop or oven. This cookware is heavy - please handle with care. Clean your cookware after each use. To clean, wipe the pan with a soft sponge or dishcloth in hot water and rinse; do not use detergents, because they will remove the seasoning. Never put cast iron cookware in the dishwasher. Make sure that you thoroughly dry before storing; this can be done by wiping the pan dry, then heating the pan on the stove for a few minutes and then allowing it to cool. TO PREVENT RUSTING: always wash by hand, dry thoroughly, do not put in the dishwasher or use detergents. FOR BEST RESULTS: Re-season your cookware regularly: To season the pan, coat the entire surface of the pan (inside and outside) with any kind of vegetable oil, spray, or melted solid shortening. Use a cloth or paper towel to spread the oil. Heat your oven to 300\u00b0F and place the pan inside for about one hour. Remove the pan from the oven while still hot and place it on the stove to cool.
