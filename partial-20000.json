The TravelMate(R) Memory Foam Travel Neck Pillow is specifically designed in such a way that it has just the right softness to provide the most comfortable support for your neck. Unlike anything on the market, this newly released and improved version has a built-in removable (memory foam) insert so you can adjust the thickness of the pillow based on your preference. Why is this such a desirable feature? The answer is that you want to be able to adjust the thickness based on your sitting positions. For example, if you sit relatively straight, you want to be able to reduce the thickness so it will not push your head forward to the point that puts too much stress on your neck. When it comes to pillows, the old school of \"one size fits all\" just doesn't cut it since what works for others might not work for you. By dialing in the ideal restful position just for you, you now can sleep comfortably whether you are sitting straight on an airline seat or resting on a recliner at home. The thermo-sensitive memory foam will mold to your body's natural contours for a custom fit. It helps relieve the tension in your neck and shoulders due to prolonged sitting. Use it on a plane, car, or anywhere you need the extra support for your neck and shoulders. You will definitely like the soft and comfortable feel of this pillow. The cover is made of high-quality, machine-washable velour cover. Built-in elastic strap makes it easy to attach to a carry-on luggage without taking up extra space. Simply put, you get a high-end product at a fraction of the cost of what you pay at upscale specialty stores. We all know how it feels after a long flight. So do yourself a favorite and get this pillow! If it does not help you to do what it is advertised, just return it in 30 days for a full refund. No questions asked.

The Hawaiian Shaved Ice brand machine is fun and easy to operate.

Next, allow the ice to temper (or thaw) for 5-7 minutes before shaving. Remove ice from the mold and place ice into the ice crusher cup. Next, place the motor unit in position and gently press down on the motor assembly to shave a mound of soft fluffy snow.

View larger  Oster Extra-Large Digital Toaster Oven with Convection Bake A useful addition to any busy kitchen, Oster's TSSTTVXLDG extra-large digital toaster oven--beautifully housed in brushed stainless steel--takes countertop cooking to a whole new level. Whether it's the holidays and relatives are gathering for a celebratory feast, or it's simply a Tuesday night and a quick healthy meal is on the menu, the countertop oven offers a roomy interior and exceptional versatility that not only accommodates, but inspires.   Extra-large interior fits 14 slices of bread, a family-size 16-inch pizza or 13-by-9-inch casserole. View larger  Spacious Interior The toaster oven works well as a second oven or as an energy-efficient alternative to turning on the full-size oven, though no need to think small thanks to its extra-large interior. Bake anything from a family-size 16-inch frozen or take-and-bake pizza to a whole chicken, a 13-by-9-inch casserole, or a pan of bread sticks or cinnamon rolls. It can even toast up to 14 slices of bread at a time. The oven provides a removable baking pan and broil rack for baking, broiling and grilling, as well as two removable wire racks that slide neatly into place. Two oven-rack positions allow for multi-level cooking options--use just one rack in the lower position (great for cooking a tall roast) or both racks simultaneously (better for busting out batches of oatmeal chocolate-chip cookies).   Make anything from crispy-crust pizza to homemade chocolate-chip cookies and more.  Digital Controls and Convection Technology Digital controls keep things simple for both the novice and experienced home chef alike. Simply press the easy-clean touch-pad to make the desired selection. Functions include Toast, Bake, Broil, Warm, Defrost, and Pizza.    User-friendly digital control panel with Convection Bake setting. View larger  There's also a Convection Bake setting that uses turbo convection-heat technology, which means more even browning and faster results--without compromising on quality. With Convection Bake, hot air circulates throughout the oven's interior, just like with a high-end full-size oven, which means it's possible to effortlessly achieve juicy meat and flavorful, gently cooked vegetables, as well as crispy edges and flakey crusts. Even more, the user-friendly control panel provides a Temp button with up and down arrows for increasing or decreasing the cooking temperature (from 150 to 450 degrees F) and a Timer button with up and down arrows for setting the 90-minute timer, which shuts off automatically once the desired time has ended. The control panel also includes a clock digitally displaying the time of day. Sleek Design Thoughtfully constructed, the extra-large digital toaster oven sports a large, fully transparent, glass door that makes it possible to keep an eye on cooking food without letting heat escape by having to open the door. It also comes with a full-length cool-touch door handle, a smooth interior that cleans up in a snap, and an external removable crumb tray. Where to begin? The toaster oven provides a variety of mouthwatering recipes like brie and artichoke bruschetta, cinnamon toast, and honey mustard chicken with spicy pecan cornflake crust, as well as mustard and herb pork tenderloin with roasted potatoes and roasted turkey breast with aromatic vegetables. Attractively housed in brushed stainless steel, the extra-large toaster oven measures 20 inches long by 24 inches wide by 13 inches high.

Natural nonstick The uncoated carbon steel bowl must be seasoned to create a durable, 100% natural nonstick finish. To season the wok, oil should be rubbed around the bowl to fill in any pores in the carbon steel surface. The wok should then be heated until the oil starts to smoke. After removing the wok from heat, let it cool, and use a paper towel to wipe off the excess oil. Repeat the entire process 2-3 times. At this stage, the center of the wok may darken in color. The wok will continue to darken with use. This is the natural process of a well-seasoned wok and will protect the surface from rust and prevent food from sticking. As the Chinese say, \"the darker the wok, the better the cook!\" Easy to handle The beech wood handle with cast aluminum flame guard and beech wood helper handle are heat resistant and allow for easy stir frying and transfer.

ANATOMY OF A BLENDER    FORGET THE WRIST WORKOUT Blendtec's extra-strong jar material is exceptionally light. So the only thing you need to worry about lifting is your next delicious blend.              HARD CARBON BRUSHES  You didn't know that motors have brushes, did you? They do. And they can wear out quickly. Unless they're made of electrographitic carbon, like in a Blendtec blender. Then they'll last a very, very long time.      STAINLESS STEEL \u2013 THE PROFESSIONAL'S CHOICE Blendtec's ultra-hard stainless steel blades are cold-forged and tuned for heavy use. This allows them to be stronger and resist corrosion much better than lesser blades. SINGLE BLADE, MANY ADVANTAGES Blendtec's patented vertical wingtips and precision angles are engineered for ultimate efficiency. The distinct single-blade design allows your ingredients to fall easily in front of the blades.              THE FIGHT AGAINST FRICTION Friction is the nemesis of all high-powered equipment. Ball bearings reduce friction so you can blend faster and quieter. It's all surrounded by a rubber mount that absorbs the shock produced by blending ice and frozen fruit.      POWER FOR THE PEOPLE The most powerful motor available for home blenders is at the heart of your Blendtec experience. More power means easier blending of the most stubborn ingredients. SAFETY MATTERS Be assured that even a blender as powerful as a Blendtec blender is ETL certified, which means it meets national safety standards.              DOES YOUR BLENDER\u2014HAVE A BRAIN? Most blenders are dumb. It's pretty much \"go\" and \"stop,\" with a few speeds in between. But a Blendtec looks after itself \u2013 monitoring everything from speed to operating temperature to motor safety. All while ?flawlessly executing pre-programmed blend cycles.      NO DETAIL TOO SMALL Even the smallest parts in a Blendtec product have received big attention from our engineers. Blade assembly nut Round and smooth for easy cleaning\u2014and\u2014permanently attached at the factory \u2013 adding to jar safety. Bearing assembly Sonically welded into the jar for extra strength and durability.              SEE IT, USE ITOut of sight, out of mind? Forget it. Blendtec's small size and low profile mean you can store your blender in plain sight right where you can use it most \u2014 on your countertop.

Slide and drop the runway into the upper position for julienne or the lower position for slicing and shredding. Tighten the knobs to lock the runway in place.

The shredding blade will only work on the 1/16-inch setting.  Push the prongs of the food holder into the food to secure it.  Hold the mandoline's handle firmly with one hand. With the cut-resistant glove on your other hand, grip the food holder and slide it down the runway and over the blade in a smooth, even movement. Repeat. Squeeze the side grips to lower the food while guiding it into the cutting blade.  When done, always engage the safety cover and store the blades in the unit.

Is your coffee is too hot? Use Joulies to cool it down and keep it perfect. Tired of burning your tongue on coffee only to have it get cold a few minutes later? With Coffee Joulies your coffee will be ready to drink faster and will stay hot longer. This works thanks to a special material sealed inside the polished stainless steel shell called a \"phase change material\" that is able to absorb a large amount of energy as it melts at a specific temperature. We use a PCM that melts at 140 degrees Fahrenheit, which we have found to be the perfect temperature for drinking any hot beverage including coffee, tea and hot chocolate. This material is food-based and completely nontoxic. Each Coffee Joulie works with 4 ounces of hot beverage, so toss one in your espresso, two in your double-short vanilla latte, three in your tall drip, four in your vacuum thermos and five in your venti or xl coffee right when it's poured. The material sealed inside the Joulie will begin to melt, absorbing energy from your coffee and cooling it down to the right temperature, 140 degrees Fahrenheit, three times faster. When your coffee reaches this temperature the process reverses. The phase change material begins solidifying, releasing the energy it stored earlier back into your coffee, keeping it hot twice as long. When used in a high-quality vacuum thermos, Coffee Joulies can keep your coffee in the right temperature range for over five hours.

The adjustable thermostat temperature control ranges from 105 to 165 degrees Fahrenheit, making it safe to dehydrate meat for jerky. The fan, heating element and thermostat are in the back of the unit, so cool air is drawn in, heated and then distributed evenly over each tray. This patented Parallex Horizontal Airflow is exclusive to Excalibur and helps the food dehydrate faster, retain more nutrients, and look and taste better \u2013 all without manual tray rotation. Since 1973, Excalibur has been made in Sacramento, California. Over the years, Excalibur has taken the lead in advancements related to the mechanics of dehydration including air flow, heating dynamics, and materials. Any dehydrator will dry food. An Excalibur dries safer, better, and faster, thanks to Excalibur's patented Hyperwave Fluctuation technology. Ordinary dehydrators produce constant, unchanging heat, which can cause\"case hardening.\" Ordinary dehydrators create a dry surface with moisture trapped inside \u2013 the perfect environment for yeast, mold and bacteria growth. With the Excalibur Hyperwave Fluctuation technology, the temperature fluctuates up and down to prevent this from happening. When the air temperature fluctuates up, the food's surface moisture evaporates; then, when the air temperature fluctuates down, the the inner moisture moves to the drier surface. This keeps the food temperature low enough to keep the enzymes active, but the air temperature gets high enough to dry food and overcome yeast, mold, and spoilage. Product Features 9 trays and 15 square feet of drying space. No moving food or trays during dehydration.Adjustable Thermostat 105 to 165 degrees Fahrenheit. Safe to dry meat for jerky.Accurate temperature controls to dry fruits, vegetables, meats, flowers, herbs, pet treats, arts & crafts.Dehydrate faster with square trays that hold more food.Remove trays as needed to increase the height needed to dehydrate bulky items or raise dough.7-inch fan, 600 watts.

The moisture that humidifiers add to dry air also help alleviate many common nuisances brought on by winter heating such as static electricity, peeling wallpaper, shrinking wood, and cracks in paint and furniture. All Natural, Non Medicated Relief from Dryness, Cough, Cold, and Flu Symptoms. Humidifiers are an ideal choice for relieving the discomforts of nasal congestion, dry itchy skin and hair, chapped lips, nose bleeds, and dry throats. Recent studies by the Center for Disease Control have also shown that relative humidity levels between 43% and 60% helps prevent the movement of germs, including the flu virus. An Adorable Baby Essential is the Perfect Baby Shower Gift! Humidifiers are especially important for Newborns because they are Obligate Nasal Breathers, breathing only through their tiny noses for their first 4 - 6 months. Any congestion can make breathing, feeding, and sleeping incredibly difficult for your little one.

The moisture that humidifiers add to dry air also helps alleviate many common nuisances brought on by winter heating such as static electricity, peeling wallpaper, shrinking wood, and cracks in paint and furniture. Humidifiers are an ideal choice for relieving the discomforts of nasal congestion, dry itchy skin and hair, chapped lips, nose bleeds, and dry throats.

Humidifiers are especially important for Newborns because they are Obligate Nasal Breathers, breathing only through their tiny noses for their first 4 - 6 months. Any congestion can make breathing, feeding, and sleeping incredibly difficult for your little one.

Convenient food-storage containers Airtight and watertight Made of high-quality BPA-free plastic Food-safe and hygienic 4-sided locking system with silicone seal Durable construction Stackable and nestable for space-saving storage Microwave- and dishwasher-safe Available in a variety of shapes and sizes    Lock&Lock Food-Storage Solutions Save Food, Save Money, Save Space A useful addition to any busy household, Lock&Lock's Classic plastic food-storage containers come in handy for storing fresh and frozen foods--from healthy snacks like cut-up fruits and vegetables to leftovers or dinners for the week. They also work well for keeping pasta, rice, flour, sugar, crackers, cookies, and other cupboard or pantry items fresh for longer, securely stored, and neatly organized. Even more, the versatile storage containers can be used to transport lunches to and from work or school--or even for storing smaller kitchen, office, or craft items. Lock&Lock's full line of Classic food-storage containers offers a wide range of shapes and sizes--each with a securely locking lid for airtight storage and peace of mind. Furthermore, the clear body of the containers makes identifying contents easy--no labels required.    Ideal for wet or dry food storage. Airtight Containers with Four-Sided Locking System    Lock&Lock's Classic food-storage containers feature an innovative four-sided locking system for an airtight seal and watertight storage so food stays fresh longer and there's no messy leaks or spills to worry about. The four sides of the locking system promote an airtight seal due to equal pressure to all four sides, along with the hollow-center silicon sealing ring that makes it possible to lock tightly (the silicone sealing ring can be removed for cleaning if necessary). Made of high-quality BPA-free plastic, Lock&Lock's Classic food-storage containers not only offer an airtight and watertight seal, but they're also durably built for unbreakable, long-lasting use and hygienic, food-safe storage. The containers can withstand temperatures ranging from -4 degrees F to 210 degrees F, making them suitable for use in the freezer, microwave* (reheating only), and dishwasher (top-rack). The base and lid should NOT be used in the oven, under browning elements, or on the stove top. Another thoughtful design detail includes the fact that the containers can be nested together, and with the lid in place, they can be stacked one on top of the other--particularly useful where space is limited. *Unlock all four latches and loosen lid before use in microwave. Detailed Features Patented Blocking Hole System    Consistent flow of resin--does not produce a weld line along the hinge. Inconsistent flow of resin--produces a weld line over time.   Lock&Lock Classic lids feature four side flaps or \"wings\" that are hinged and slightly flared at the end for an easy grip when opening. More importantly, they come with holes (rectangular-shaped openings) that line up with matching knobs on the base of the containers, making it easy to latch the lid to the base, locking it into place. This patented blocking hole system maintains the integrity of the lid and helps promote an easy, tightly locked container.  Lid's 4 wings come with holes that line up with base Weld line does not form around the hinge piece Hinge is designed to be short in length to prevent stiffness when opening and closing    Blue hollow-center silicon band in the lid helps create an airtight, leak-proof seal. Special Silicone In addition to its blocking hole system, the Classic food-storage containers feature a blue hollow-center silicon ring in the lid that helps create an airtight, leak-proof seal. Generic silicon with a solid center doesn't compress as well and doesn't have the same restorative power as hollow-center silicon, which means an inferior seal. Lock&Lock's hollow-center silicon seal delivers superior compression and restoration power that helps ensure an airtight seal. Permeability When testing the freshness of foods, one of the most important factors is the permeability of the container. In comparison to other brands, the permeability of Lock&Lock products showed to be drastically better.   Strawberries stored at room temperature for 5 days. The freshness test is determined throughout the world by how much moisture permeates various containers. Test results show Lock&Lock airtight containers allow in 3,000 - 6,000 times less moisture than other containers, making them far more airtight.   Airtight seal means no messy spills or leaks to worry about. Excellent Airtight Seal Lock&Lock airtight containers passed the leakage test. Their four-sided locking system makes an airtight seal possible due to equal pressure on all four sides and the hollow-center silicone sealing ring.   Passed the KEMTI bending test. Durable Design Lock&Lock airtight containers have also passed the KEMTI bending test. The container and the wing were fixed to the bending test machine and bent 3,000,000 times 80 degrees left to right. If the container were to be used 10 times a day, it could be used for 821 years (semi-permanently).   Hygienic and food-safe. Healthy Living Lock&Lock Classic food-storage containers have passed the strict hygiene and safety tests of the U.S. FDA and German SGS. Made of high-quality BPA-free plastic, the durable and heat-resistance containers are food-safe and health-friendly.   Nest and stack for space-saving storage. Space-Saving Design When not in use, the cleverly designed food-storage containers nest together, both lids and bases, for compact storage in a drawer or on a shelf. The containers also offer a stacking system for maximum space efficiency. The flat lids make it easy to stack one container on top of another--a slight edge helps to keep stacked items in securely place, whether in the freezer, refrigerator, or cupboard.

Due to this uniqueness, there may be slight variations from piece to piece. Le Creuset Stoneware is safe for use in the microwave, freezer, refrigerator, dishwasher, oven and broiler. The maximum oven-safe temperature is 500 degrees F / 260 degrees C. The enameled surface is easy to clean and scratch-resistant. The enamel is completely hygienic and will not absorb odors or flavors. Le Creuset Stoneware is extremely strong and durable, and resists staining, chipping and cracking. The handles, knobs and rims have been designed for a secure, easy-to-hold grip. Cleaning and Care DO NOT use any Stoneware piece on the stovetop or any other direct heat source. OVEN: Maximum oven-safe temperature is 500 degrees F / 260 degrees C. Use oven mitts for lifting at all times. BROILER: When using under a broiler allow a gap of no less than 2 1/2 inches between the rim of the dish and the heat source. MICROWAVE: Handles may become hot during prolonged microwave use, especially if the handles are enclosed with plastic wrap. Cover just the open top of the dish, leaving the handles exposed. FREEZER-TO-OVEN USE: Do not place a frozen dish of food in a preheated oven. Place the frozen dish in a cold oven and set the temperature, allowing the dish and oven to heat together. Before serving always check that the center of the food is completely and uniformly hot. CLEANING: Before the first use, wash the dish in hot, soapy water, and rinse and dry thoroughly. For most day-to-day cleaning, cool the dish for a few minutes before washing and drying, or wash in the dishwasher, allowing the full cycle to complete. Never leave a dish fully immersed in water. For removal of stubborn residues allow the dish to cool, fill with warm, soapy water and allow it to soak for 10 to 20 minutes.

Designed with both kitchen style and practicality in mind, the Countertop Oven with Convection & Rotisserie is portable and countertop convenient. It's packed with versatile cooking options that range from baking cakes to crisping cookies to broiling salmon to roasting an entire 5 lb. chicken, roast or pork. There's no need to spend extra time cooking separate meals for the pickier ones, either. The wide interior and adjustable cooking racks provide double the space for cooking multiple foods at once.  What's more, this oven is ideal for anyone, anywhere and anytime. It can replace the microwave in your office, offer easy cooking access for the elderly, serve as a staple for apartment dwellers or provide snack enthusiasts with a little added treat.

No sweat \u2013 the Hamilton Beach Countertop Oven provides extra capacity for second oven convenience as well as four ways to cook: BAKE, CONVECTION, BROIL and ROTISSERIE.  Doubles Your Baking Options with Convection Technology A 9\"x13\" baking pan can be found in most kitchens in North America, used for making everything from lasagna to brownies. Not only does this oven fit two 9\"x13\" pans at once, unlike conventional ovens without convection technology, the Countertop Oven with Convection comes fully equipped. Instead of having heat come from just one central area and no fan to \"stir-up\" or circulate air evenly all over, this oven's convection technology utilizes a top and bottom heating element and a built-in fan to distribute heat evenly for a uniform temperature. That way, bakers can choose between traditional baking \u2013 ideal for cupcakes, cakes and soft baked goods \u2013 or convection baking \u2013 ideal for a crispy pizzas, cookies or even taquitos. For light and fluffy soft baked goods like cupcakes, cakes or pastries, follow these BAKE directions. For crispier foods like pizzas or cookies, use CONVECTION BAKE, which forces more air to circulate in the oven, so foods will cook faster at the same oven temperature:  Before setting to BROIL, place food directly on small baking pan or on broil rack stacked directly on small baking pan and place in oven. DO NOT PREHEAT.Set the TEMPERATURE to BROIL/ROTISSERIE.Set FUNCTION to BROIL. Note: Only upper heating elements will be on in BROIL mode.BROIL: Rotate Timer past 40 minutes, then to desired broiling time or rotate to STAY ON. Note: Turn food when browned or halfway through cooking time.  For roasted chicken, beef roast or pork roast, follow these ROTISSERIE directions:  Before setting to ROTISSERIE, slide large coated baking pan in lowest rack position. Tie chicken and large pieces of meat tightly with cotton string to prevent meat from hitting baking pan. For further instructions, search World Wide Web on \"How to Truss a Chicken for Rotisserie.\"Insert Rotisserie rod lengthwise into center of meat, and insert rotisserie forks on rod lengthwise into lower bottom half of meat. Make sure meat is centered evenly between rotisserie rod and fork ends, and tighten screws on rotisserie forks.Manually insert pointed end of rod holding chicken into oven rotisserie insert, rotating the rod as needed to fit and then place square end of rod into slot in bracket on left side.Set TEMPERATURE to BROIL/ROTISSERIE. Set FUNCTION to ROTISSERIEBAKE: Rotate Timer past 40 minutes, then set Timer to desired time or rotate to STAY ON.  Note: Only upper heating elements will be on during ROTISSERIE mode.  To remove cooked meat from oven, place rotisserie lift with hooks under rotisserie rod. Lift and slide rotisserie rod to the left and remove from oven. Place meat on a clean surface to cool slightly, and using oven mitts, unscrew rotisserie forks and remove rotisserie rod. Slide meat onto cutting surface or serving tray before carving.

In fact, this oven effortlessly caters to your hectic schedule. Simply set from 300\u00b0 to 350\u00b0 to quickly reheat biscuits, leftover roasts or casseroles and set to 150\u00b0 to keep food warm while you're waiting for guests to arrive or busy multitasking.  Full-Performance Ovens Preferred Over Toaster Ovens  Significant numbers of American consumers use their toaster ovens for more than just toast, and many are also eating at home to save money, eat healthier and manage ingredients. Look no further, the Hamilton Beach Countertop Oven with Convection & Rotisserie combines all these features into one. With an extra-large capacity to fit an entire meal for a family of four, additional BROIL settings for the health-conscious and offering four ways to cook, this appliance satisfies the palate, the diet and the budget. Easy Cleanup The full-width crumb/drip tray slides out from the front, allowing easy washing. For the best oven performance, cleaning should be done regularly. Unplug first and allow oven to cool before interior and exterior cleaning. For interior cleaning: wipe oven walls, bottom tray and glass door with a damp, soapy cloth, but do not scratch or damage heating element tube. Repeat with a damp, clean cloth. All removable parts should be hand washed in warm, soapy water as well. For stubborn interior stains, use a plastic scouring pad. For exterior cleaning: wipe oven walls with a damp cloth, but do not use abrasive cleansers or metal scouring pads; this can scrape/scratch the surface.  TIPS & CARE  Before cooking with the oven, always PREHEAT for approximately 5 minutes. Check pan manufacturer's directions for oven-safe rating. Do not cover the crumb/drip tray or any part of the oven in aluminum foil (causes overheating); however, use of aluminum foil to partially cover casseroles or some foods is acceptable.

The two heater modules can be used combined like a traditional heater, or they can be separated to direct heat toward two separate places. The unique tethered heater modules can be placed up to 6-feet apart--one on the floor and one on a desktop, one on each side of a chair, or each aimed at different people. You can select heat from both modules together and from either the left or right separately. The ACH-120 puts you in complete control of your environment. The Two Zone Story Ambia's two zone idea was born from the frustration in trying to find the perfect position for a single heater. No matter how hard you try, it\u2019s just impossible to perfect the position. Either one person sits comfortably in a room while another is cold or hands freeze while feet bake. We knew we needed to add another dimension to space heaters, and to allow everyone to be comfortable. That\u2019s when the Ambia line of two zone heaters was born. A two zone heater allows you to customize your comfort with modules that you can separate and position, like surround sound speakers. No longer will you have to choose who or what stays warm. Perfect For So Many Uses Ambia\u2019s ACH-120 two zone heater is ideal for a host of situations. You can set the unit up above and below a desk so keep your hands and feet equally warm. Or simply set both modules facing one chair to create a cozy envelope of heat. You can even set each module to face different people in the same room so everyone can be comfortable. With the Ambia ACH-120 you can truly customize your comfort. Adjustable Thermostat It\u2019s easy to dial in to the perfect temperature setting and then choose between heating the left, right, or both modules for the perfect level of comfort--every time. It\u2019s also easy to store, with handy cord storage that lets you keep your tether cord stored neatly in the rear compartment to prevent clutter.

HEPA - High Efficiency Particulate Air. It was a technology developed in the 1940\u2019s by the U. S. Atomic Energy Commission to full-fill a top-secret need for an efficient way to filter radioactive particulate contaminants. HEPA is a type of highly efficient filtration media that removes microscopic particles from air passing through the filter. There are different ranges of efficiencies depending on the particle size. The most efficient form of HEPA removes 99.97% of particles with a size of 0.3 microns that pass through the filter. A HEPA air purifier will not capture chemical gasses.

(3-cup) Chopping bowl with stainless steel chopping blade for herbs, nuts and cheese.  42oz. Extra-large jug with dual-purpose storage lid and anti-slip mat. Ideal for blending, measuring and storing ingredients Why the Breville Control Grip Immersion Blender? Sometimes, making a simple soup can be hard work. Immersion blenders are supposed to make cooking easier, but they can often create problems instead of solving them: creating splatters, suctioning to the bottom of the bowl, and scratching pots.  How can you control the power you need to get the texture you want? The Breville Control Grip immersion blender has a redesigned blade system to address these problems: a bell-shaped base and internal ribbing break suction for greater control and efficient blending. This is how the Breville Control Grip stands apart: whatever you need to blend, the Breville Control Grip has got it under control. New design for excellent performance The Breville Control Grip\u2019s blade system has internal ribs that create turbulence. This unique system makes sure the food falls onto the blades, reducing suction to the bottom of the pot. It also gives you precise control over texture, with 15 variable speeds, while the 8 inch immersion depth for large quantities or tall pots means that you can blend directly in the pot for less mess and more convenience. No more transferring soups from the pot to the food processor and back. The powerful 280 watt motor generates circulation, making sure all the ingredients are blended evenly. These features make the Breville Control Grip excellent for multi-tasking, whether it\u2019s blending, emulsifying, whipping, or pureeing. Use it to make velvety soups, thick mayonnaise, fluffy whipped cream, chunky pesto, dips, and salsa, smoothies, baby food and more. Get a grip on excellent blending The Breville Control Grip features an ergonomically optimized handle designed to fit your hand comfortably. Trigger operation keeps your hand in natural position for more stability and control, and its soft touch finish makes sure it\u2019s easy on your hand, even when it\u2019s hard on your food. Designed with the Consumer in Mind With all of these features, it\u2019s no wonder that the Breville Control Grip has been rated the best immersion blender by a leading consumer magazine, beating out higher priced models. It\u2019s built with high quality materials: the blending shaft is made of premium plastic and the ice-crushing blades are made of stainless steel, ensuring durability. A 6 foot extra-long power cord makes the unit portable and convenient, providing the mobility of a cordless immersion blender but making sure that it is always ready to go when you need it (no charging necessary). The bottom of the blender has a non-scratch base to prevent it from scratching your non-stick pots. It includes both a blending jug and chopping bowl. The chopping bowl can be stored compactly in the jug for convenience and the lid of the blending jug can be used as a base to prevent slipping while blending. Easy clean parts can be hand washed and most parts (except motor and chopper lid) can be washed in the dish washer on the top shelf only, making cleanup quick and easy. Product Features   Variable speed: 15 settings for precise control 6\u2019 extra-long cord: for increased portability and movement Ergonomically designed handle: for reduced hand strain  Trigger operation: the hand assumes a more natural position for increased stability and control Soft touch finish: for increased comfort and reduced slipping  280W Motor 8\" immersion depth: for blending large quantities in tall pots and containers Bell-shaped base: revolutionary shape plus internal ribbing reduces suction for greater control and more efficient blending Stainless steel ice crushing blades Non-scratch guard: protect pots and pans from scratching Compact storage: blending jug houses the chopping bowl for easier processing and convenient storage Storage lid: doubles as a non-slip base ", "salesrank_2018": "366816"}, "B005BX039Y": {"description": "Get the best sleep of your life with Hampton Direct Total Pillow.

It eliminates a common problem for all connoisseurs of fine distilled spirits:  it cools your drink perfectly without the dilution from melting ice.  Now all your favorite drinks are able to be served the way they were intended to be, perfectly pure and precisely chilled.  Sipping Stones are non-porous meaning there is no odor or taste to tarnish your drink.  And unlike ice, Sipping Stones provides a smooth chill that does not overwhelm the character of your beverage.  Each set of Sipping Stones comes with nine finely crafted cubes made from soapstone, a safe alternative to ice. Sipping Stones is a great gift for anyone who loves the perfectly chilled beverage.  Or you can use it as a conversation starter at your next party.  Simply keep the Sipping Stones in your freezer until you are ready to chill your favorite drink, alcoholic or otherwise.\n\n\nUse:  Rinse before first usage then place in your freezer until the stones are as cold as desired.  When ready, add two or three stones to your glass.  Fill the glass with enough liquid to cover the stones.  Let the drink sit for a few minutes to allow the stones to chill your drink.  After use, simply rinse and allow the stones to dry before returning them to your freezer.  Never chew or attempt to eat.\n\nAbout Soapstone:  Known for its ability to maintain a temperature for long periods of time, natural soapstone is listed as Generally Regarded As Safe (GRAS) by the FDA.  Soapstone is made up of talc which will not react to water, alcohol and or other drinks.  If used with care, soapstone will not scratch your glasses.\nProper Usage: Sipping Stones are not meant to cool as a drink as quickly or as much as ice. They are intended to provide a slight chill-between 8 and 15 degrees-that will protect the taste without drowning the quality.", "salesrank_2018": "24938"}, "B005D7D70K": {"description": "Includes: Three 20oz Reusable Bottle and 6 Brita Filters.", "salesrank_2018": null}}
