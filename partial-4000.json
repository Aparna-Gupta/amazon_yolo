The moisture that vaporizers add to dry air also helps alleviate many common nuisances brought on by winter heating such as static electricity, peeling wallpaper, shrinking wood, and cracks in paint and furniture. Humidifiers and Vaporizers are an ideal choice for relieving the discomforts of nasal congestion, dry itchy skin and hair, chapped lips, nose bleeds, and dry throats. Recent studies by the Center for Disease Control have also shown that relative humidity levels between 43% and 60% helps prevent the movement of germs, including the flu virus. Warm Steam Vaporizers are especially important for Newborns because they are Obligate Nasal Breathers, breathing only through their tiny noses for their first 4 - 6 months. Any congestion can make breathing, breathing, and sleeping incredibly difficult for your little one. Not only that, but many pediatricians recommend the use of a humidifier or vaporizer as a safe, non medicated, all natural alternative to help relieve congestion from the common cold and flu instead of potentially harmful over-the-counter cough and cold medicine.

Too cold and it could mask the vintner's uniquely crafted complexities. Too warm and the flavors may take a back seat to the alcohol. The answer to this perplexity? Corkcicle.  The first of its kind, Corkcicle is an innovative product designed to keep your white wines chilled and bring your room temperature reds down to a more suitable \"cellar\" temperature, without the need for an ice bucket. Ice buckets often make white wine too cold, masking the flavors and complexities of the wine, not to mention they are messy and bulky. With Corkcicle, wines are chilled from the inside of the bottle so you can enjoy perfectly chilled wine every time.  Simple to use, just throw Corkcicle in the freezer for 90 minutes. After pouring the first glass of chilled white, drop it in the bottle to maintain the perfect temperature. For reds, pour a taste and insert Corkcicle for twelve minutes to lower the temperature to the mid 60's. Made from BPA free plastic and non-toxic freeze gel, Corkcicle has an elegant and innovative design that keeps wine cool for a perfect glass every time. Another perk about the Corkcicle? You can use it again and again. No need to throw it away. Even after countless uses, it keeps your whites and lighter chilled reds at a perfect drinking temperature. And it even brings those heavier room temperature reds down to a more suitable drinking temperature. Use your Corkcicle at home, bring it to your next party or take it on-the-go. This wine chiller is perfect for your next outdoor barbeque, picnic or intimate evening at home. The Corkcicle also makes for the perfect gift for the wino in your life. Available in original cork as well as six pop inspired colors, including white, orange, pink, green, blue and yellow.  Product Features Corkcicle maintains chilled white wines and cools room temperature redsSimple to use; freeze and place in bottleMade from BPA free plastic and non-toxic freeze gelEliminates the need for an ice bucketEasy to clean; rinse under water and place in freezer 90 minutes before useAvailable in several pop-inspired colors or original corkPerfect for both at home or on-the-go wine chillingThis innovative product is the first of its kind Our Story We make things that cool. We make cool things. Since we launched, we've heard quite a few stories on how we first got the idea for the Corkcicle. And while we wish we'd been inspired while sipping warmish wine in an icicle-rimmed Aspen chalet, that's not the case. The truth is that Ben Hewitt, Corkcicle's inventor and company founder, simply loves wine and hated that there wasn't a better solution to bothersome wine buckets. In November 2011, Ben started tinkering in his garage, creating prototype after prototype. Aided with the marketing expertise of his friend and business partner, Stephen Bruner, the idea quickly became a reality. More to the point, Stephen brought a high design approach to the product with the name and its icicle form to create our beloved Corkcicle. As the manufacturing process got underway, it became clear that we needed a rainmaker to help deliver the product and get it effectively introduced to the retail world. A close friend, Eric Miller, VP of Sales at a Fortune 100 medical device company, came on board and has been making it rain Corkcicles ever since. Together, the three have built a brand that represents true American ingenuity and captures the essence of the entrepreneurial spirit. Proving that great ideas still matter and that with hard work and great partners, anything's possible.

The FlexBrew Single-Serve Coffeemaker allows the flexibility of brewing freshly ground coffee one minute or an instant K-Cup pack or coffee pod the next. With its revolutionary method of brewing, the FlexBrew Single-Serve coffeemaker is the ideal solution for coffee drinkers who value flexibility in their morning routine.  A new favorite among coffee enthusiasts for its convenience and user-friendly features, the FlexBrew Single-Serve Coffeemaker costs only pennies to make fresh-ground coffee and boasts a major advantage over other single-serve brewers: a removable K-Cup pack holder to allow for pre-measured and pre-packaged coffee.  PRODUCT FEATURE BENEFITS Compatible with coffee grounds, K-Cup packs or soft podsBetter coffee extraction than the leading competitor Adjustable cup rest allows for standard-size cups or travel mugs Durable, stainless steel features and dishwasher safe, removable parts10-oz. brewing capacity (travel mug not included) Coffeemaker shuts off automatically when brew cycle is complete Equipped with a \"Quick Start\" Guide with simple, step-by-step brewing guidelinesCustomer service support available through a US toll-free number  Brewing with a K-Cup Pack  For some java drinkers, pouring fresh-ground coffee into their coffeemaker is the perfect start to their day. For other coffee lovers, being able to quickly insert a pre-packaged, single portion pack into their coffeemaker and enjoy a piping hot cup in a few minutes is a match made in heaven. The FlexBrew Single-Serve Coffeemaker offers the added convenience factor of a pack holder, which allows quick instant brewing in less time than an in-store caf\u00e9 experience. Simply insert the K-Cup pack and push the lever down \u2013 that's it.  Brewing with Ground Coffee  Pre-packaged coffee isn't for everyone or every palate. The FlexBrew Single-Serve Coffeemaker caters to coffee aficionados by featuring a steel mesh scoop filter that holds a variety of fresh-tasting ground coffee. You can grind your own coffee beans to the medium-grind setting or save time and purchase pre-ground coffee. Brands such as Folders, Maxwell House, Dunkin' Donuts, and Starbucks are recommended because they are medium-grind coffees.  Note: Coffee that is ground too finely will cause an overflow. If you are unsure about the coarseness of your coffee, check with your coffee manufacturer.  Alternative Options to Coffee  Not a coffee drinker or prefer other varieties of hot beverages? The FlexBrew Single-Serve Coffeemaker, unlike home-brewers that solely brew their own type of coffee, allows for a variety of tea pods, including herbal, chai, white, green, black and flavorful blends.  Measuring Portions Appropriately  Not sure how much coffee grinds to add when brewing your next cup? No worries, the unit comes equipped with a brew basket, marked with a 2- tablespoon MAX line for exact measuring, so there's no overspilling. For busier schedules, use the K-Cup pack holder, which is already portioned for single servings. About Homemade Brewing Did you know that 86 percent of coffee drinkers still brew most of their java at home? With more and more Americans picking up the coffee habit, staying awake longer, and cutting back to save money, coffeemakers are now being designed to be more feasible and economical for the home budget and lifestyle. *Source: 2012, National Coffee Association of USA  TIPS & CARE  The FlexBrew Single-Serve Coffeemaker performs best with medium-grind coffee; coffee that is too finely ground may affect the extraction time or filtering process. Keep ground coffee below MAX fill line and do not use more than 10 ounces (410 ml) of water. When using the K-Cup pack holder, press down on the edge of the pack until the pack clicks into place and the hole is punched in the bottom \u2013 do not remove foil. Allow two minutes to cool in-between brews.  The brew basket and K-Cup pack holder should be rinsed after every use. Removable parts, such as the K-Cup Pack Holder, Handle and Lock, drip tray, cup rest and basket itself, are all dishwasher safe. For trouble-free maintenance, the FlexBrew Single-Serve Coffeemaker should be cleaned internally once a month, by pouring \u00bd cup plain white vinegar and \u00bd cup cold water into the water reservoir, brewing and then running 2-3 cycles of cold tap water before making the next round of coffee.

Some accounts trace the Guild's birth to Athens in the latter half of the 4th century BCE. Allegedly, several lesser philosophers grew weary of the endless Socratic dialogue endemic in their trade and turned to crafting household implements and playthings. (Hence the assertions that Socrates quaffed his hemlock poison from a Guild-designed chalice, though vigorous debate surrounds the question of whether it was a \"disappearing\" chalice.) Others argue that the UPG dates from the High Middle Ages, when the Philosophers Guild entered the world of commerce by selling bawdy pamphlets to pilgrims facing long lines for the restroom. Business boomed until 1211 when Pope Innocent III condemned the publications. Not surprisingly, this led to increased sales, even as half our membership was burned at the stake. More recently, revisionist historians have pinpointed the birth of the Guild to the time it was still cool to live in New York City's Lower East Side. Two brothers turned their inner creativity and love of paying rent towards fulfilling the people's needs for finger puppets, warm slippers, coffee cups, and cracking up at stuff.

Advanced fuzzy logic technology with AI (Artificial Intelligence) \"learns\" and adjusts the cooking cycle to get perfect results every time. This rice cooker will automatically select from 3 pressure settings according to the menu selected for the best cooking results. The platinum infused nonstick inner cooking pan changes the water quality and allows rice to absorb water easily for better tasting rice.

The ETL-approved 1,370-watt rice cooker and warmer measures 11-1/8 by 16-1/2 by 10-1/8 inches.  Make every rice type imaginable with a Zojirushi Rice Cooker Brown Rice This is a menu setting designed to cook delicious brown rice. In order to cook hard rice bran and the rice inside, preheating time is extended for better absorption of water, and is cooked at a lower temperature to allow the rice to cook longer without becoming mushy. Sushi Rice Because sushi rice will be processed after it's cooked, it's easier to handle when it is a little firmer. This menu setting is very similar to regular white rice, but uses less water (adjusted by the water fill lines) for a firm finish. Mixed Rice Mixed rice is rice cooked with additional ingredients and seasonings. This setting extends preheating for better absorption of seasoning. Also, the cooking temperature is slightly lower than regular white rice, to avoid ingredients from boiling over. Porridge Instead of cooking rice in larger amounts of water and risk making it sloppy, use the porridge setting to cook fluffy porridge. Cooking temperature is slightly lower than regular white rice, to be cooked longer for soft texture.  A newly discovered way of cooking brown rice to \"activate\" it and increase natural occurring gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), an amino acid in brown rice believed to have health giving properties such as lowering blood pressure, improving kidney function and relieving stress. The brown rice is \"activated\" by soaking it at 104 degrees F for 2 hours before the actual cooking begins. All Zojirushi Induction Heating System rice cookers, including the IH Pressure models, have the GABA brown rice setting. Not to be confused with Germinated Brown Rice: Germinated brown rice is a type of brown rice that has been processed. It is a type of rice that must be purchased. The process gives it a softer texture and improved taste. It also contains increased values of GABA. Germinated brown rice, sometimes also called sprouted brown rice, may be cooked using the \"Softer\" menu in most Zojirushi rice cookers. About AI Fuzzy Logic Technology  The AI (Artificial Intelligence) allows the rice cooker to \"learn\" from past cooking experiences and adjust the cooking \"flow\" to cook ideal rice. NP-NVC18 cooks rice to the same consistency in summer or winter, when water and room temperatures may be drastically different. Even after years of use, the rice cooker can cook rice to the same consistency as when the unit was new. With AI technology, the rice cooker remembers the capacity you cook most often, and selects the ideal cooking \"flow\" from the very first stage of the cooking process. Basically, the microchip does all the thinking for you to adjust cooking times and temperatures, sets the precise amount of pre-soaking time of the raw grains, and the time for the final \"wait\" period during steaming. Conventional rice cookers simply turn on and off in reaction to temperature. Fuzzy Logic Technology fine tunes this adjustment to adapt to various rice types, such as white, brown, sweet or porridge, which all have different cooking requirements. This model has separate thermometers that monitor the room temperature, the temperature inside the unit, and the temperature of the inner cooking pan to collect data to aid in the cooking and keep warm process.  What is Induction Heating (IH) Induction Heating took rice cooking to another level by literally introducing another dimension to the heating process. Where the heating element would normally be located at the bottom of the cooker, IH transforms the entire inner cooking pan into a heat conductor, allowing for higher, more precise and more uniform cooking temperatures.   IH Pressure System Pressure cooking is a method of cooking in a sealed vessel that does not permit air or liquids to escape below a preset pressure resulting in even higher temperatures. Cooking rice with pressure is a better way to turn beta starch into alpha starch, which makes the rice softer and easier to digest. (The starch in grains is beta starch. Raw rice is hard because beta-starch is rigid. Beta-starch resists digestion by any enzyme, to protect the seed from germinating when conditions are unfavorable. When rice is cooked, the starch loses its rigidity, and turns into a soft pasty alpha-starch.) This change makes the rice softer and easier to digest, and even fluffier to the taste. Rice cooked with pressure has also been found to stay soft for longer periods of time when compared to regular cooked rice.  How it works A specially designed lid keeps the cooker airtight and sealed, which prevents the steam from escaping. As pressure builds inside while the rice cooks, the boiling point of the water increases beyond the normal 212 degrees F. Once the water is allowed to boil, it cannot be heated further; but inside a sealed environment under pressure, higher temperatures can be reached, which penetrates everything in the cooker from the surface of the food to its center. The unit automatically selects from three pressure levels according to the menu selected. Three pressure settings are available to steam the rice to varying degrees of firmness; lower pressure and temperature for firmer rice, and higher pressure and heat for softer rice.  Pressure Safety Zojirushi has multiple safety features for a rice cooking experience that is as safe as possible.  Pressure Control Valve (with Pressure Release Ball) Controls the pressure level during cookingSafety Valve: Releases excessive pressure in case the pressure control valve becomes clogged or malfunctionsPressure Indicator on the control panel turns on when pressure is applied during cooking, and locks the lidInner Lid Filter: Minimizes small particles from becoming stuck inside the Pressure Control Valve, Safety Valve or Steam Vent Set Whistle: A whistling noise warns that the Pressure Control Valve or Safety Valve is clogged and needs to be cleaned   Platinum Infused Nonstick Inner Cooking Pan  The nonstick coating on the inner cooking pan is infused with platinum particles. Through research, we discovered that platinum alkalizes water. Alkaline water breaks down the protein on the surface of the rice grain, and water is able to penetrate the rice grain more easily. Enhanced gelatinization brings out the sweetness of rice ultimately making better tasting rice. The platinum particles are burnt onto ceramic particles, which are mixed into the nonstick coating. The water is alkalized when poured into the inner cooking pan and comes into contact with the platinum particles.  Umami Setting  The Umami setting soaks the rice before cooking longer than the regular white setting. During this extended soaking time, the sugar contained within the rice is slowly released out into the water. Once the rice cooker begins to cook the rice, the sugar that was released into the water reattaches itself onto the surface of the rice, making the cooked rice taste sweeter. The Umami setting also extends the steaming time at the end of the cooking cycle. Steam-Reduce Setting The Steam-Reduce setting reduces steam to 50% of the Regular Setting. The Rinse-Free setting can be used together with Steam-Reduce, but it is a separate course from other courses, and cannot be combined (e.g., you cannot cook choose Steam-Reduce when cooking sweet or mixed rice). The rice texture may be slightly harder than Regular.  Scorched Setting The Scorched setting lightly toasts the bottom of the rice for a crispy texture. This is also a separate setting, and cannot be combined with other settings. It is recommended that the rice be consumed immediately. Automatic Keep Warm Extended Keep Warm keeps cooked rice warm at a lower temperature than Regular Keep Warm to minimize drying and yellowing of rice. It is ideal to switch to Extended Keep Warm when keeping rice warm for a longer period of time. The rice cooker will switch to Regular Keep Warm automatically for 24 hours after cooking completion. The reheat function will raise the temperature of the rice closer to immediately after cooking.  Reheat Function Reheating will take about 5-8 minutes. It can be used to reheat rice kept warm under Regular or Extended Keep Warm, to bring the temperature closer to immediately after cooking.  Keep Warm Monitor The lid sensor detects how many times the lid has been opened and for how long, and calculates the amount of rice left inside the inner cooking pan. The rice cooker calculates how much heat is needed to keep the rice at the ideal keep warm temperature.  The keep warm monitor alerts you by beeping four times, 10, 40 or 70 minutes after cooking completes if the lid has not been opened, to encourage you to fluff the rice to release excessive moisture. The rice cooker will also beep four times if the lid is left open for over 5 minutes to remind you to close the lid. If unclosed, the rice cooker will beep every 3 minutes thereafter for up to 3 times. Both beeps will not sound if the rice cooker is set to \"Silent\" mode.  LCD Control Panel  Easy-to-read LCD control panel with clock and timer features. Menu Settings include: white (regular,softer, harder), umam, mixed, sushi/sweet, porridge, brown, GABA brown, steam-reduced, scorch, rinse-free and quick cooking.

Once done with dinner, turn the temperature dial to low for a versatile chocolate fondue. Dip in chunks of fruit, pound cake, marshmallow... everything tastes better in chocolate!    Chocolate Fondue Tips Use chocolate chips to produce a smooth chocolate fondue rather than chocolate blocks since they have the necessary cocoa butter. White chocolate blocks naturally have more cocoa butter than milk, semi-sweet, or bittersweet chocolate blocks, making them work just as well as white chocolate chips. Enjoy your chocolate fondue with an array of dipping options -- apple wedges, strawberries, pineapple, bananas, marshmallows, graham crackers, angel food cake and more.      Cheese Tips and Hints For the best consistency, use good melting cheeses, such as Gruy\u00e8re, Emmenthaler, Fontina, Cheddar, Monterey Jack, Swiss, Comt\u00e9, Raclette, Gouda and Edam. When making fondue, use a wine or beer that you would enjoy drinking to get your desired taste and flavor. Fondue should be served immediately after being prepared. While it can be cooled down and reheated, the consistency will be compromised. If reheating, first bring to room temperature; then turn to setting 4. Stir continuously, allowing to warm until desired consistency is reached, whisking in additional liquid as needed. When your cheese fondue is ready, grab bread, blanched broccoli or cauliflower, steamed baby potatoes, carrots or celery for great dipping combinations. Parts and Features Stainless Steel Fondue Forks: Eight individually colored forks to pierce food for dipping. Glass Lid Cover: Use to keep the contents in the pot warm.    Brushed Stainless Steel Fondue Pot: 3-quart stainless steel pot with nonstick interior to hold fondues and broths. Adjustable Temperature Control Probe: Use to select the appropriate heat settings for your fondue. Removable Lazy Susan Ring: Easily rotates serving cups around the fondue pot. Serving Cups with Brackets: The four serving cups rest inside the brackets that hook onto the Lazy Susan ring. Use the cups to organize and hold food for dipping. Recipe Booklet: Find delicious recipes in the included booklet for cheese, broth/oil, and dessert fondues.    Cleanup Made Easy The fondue pot and and serving cups feature a nonstick interior.

Which type of vacuum is better -- bagless or bagged? Neither type of vacuum is \u201cbetter\u201d than the other. BISSELL testing shows that with proper maintenance, both can clean equally well. The cleaning performance of an individual vacuum depends on many different factors. A bagged vacuum will lose its cleaning effectiveness as the bag fills with debris. The bag must be changed when it is about 1/2 to 2/3 full for the best cleaning performance. The choice between a bagged and bagless vacuum really depends on your personal preference.  What makes the Velocity Bagged Rewind vacuum different from a regular bagged vacuum? The Dirt Path Window allows you to see the dirt you pick up before it enters the bag. The bag is easy to install and monitor for fullness in between uses. How to keep vacuums running and looking their best There\u2019s nothing like a quick sweep of the vacuum to freshen a home. It\u2019s a small thing that can make a big difference, much like changing or cleaning the filters in your vacuum. Just like carpets need special care, so do vacuums. Did you know that the BISSELL Velocity Bagged Rewind vacuum has three filters? If you begin to notice performance issues, it may be time to either replace or clean your filters. For non-washable filters, we recommend they be replaced regularly for optimal performance. Clean filters are important as they help to capture dust and other particles that pass through the filter while vacuuming. To get the most out of your vacuum, remember to clean or replace your filters regularly and rely on specially designed filters directly from BISSELL.        Why Febreze Vacuum Bags?

Silver Impregnated Granulated Activated Carbon; 2.) Ionic-Exchange Resin; 3.) Far-Infrared Ceramic Beads; 4.) Silica Sand; and 5.) Mineral Sand. Activated carbon is extremely effective in the removal of chlorine, bad tastes and odors, radon, solvents, pesticides and herbicides, volatile organic chemicals and hundreds of other man-made chemicals found in tap water. The carbon is impregnated with colloidal silver to disinfect and inhibit the growth of bacteria in the water filter system. It is treated with oxygen to open up millions of tiny pores between the carbon atoms and is activated with a positive charge to attract negatively charged water contaminants. Ionic-Exchange resin softens hard water by replacing magnesium and calcium ions found in hard water with sodium ions. It purifies the water by removing toxin and heavy metal ions and replacing with more innocuous ions such as sodium and potassium. Far infrared minerals are known to promote growth and health of living cells. It ionizes and helps activate water molecules in human cells and blood. Far infrared is also known to increase the processing enzyme activity in our digestive tract, as well as boost metabolism. Silica is known to neutralize acidic elements to create an optimal pH balance in the human body. It has superb absorbent qualities to remove granular impurities and suspended solids to provide a brilliant sparkle in water. It also helps in maintaining healthy nails and radiant skin. The mineral sand in the final stage of the cartridge is comprised of over 30 different types of essential healthy minerals, such as calcium, manganese, zinc and potassium.

The TravelMate(R) Memory Foam Travel Neck Pillow is specifically designed in such a way that it has just the right softness to provide the most comfortable support for your neck. Unlike anything on the market, this newly released and improved version has a built-in removable (memory foam) insert so you can adjust the thickness of the pillow based on your preference. Why is this such a desirable feature? The answer is that you want to be able to adjust the thickness based on your sitting positions. For example, if you sit relatively straight, you want to be able to reduce the thickness so it will not push your head forward to the point that puts too much stress on your neck. When it comes to pillows, the old school of \"one size fits all\" just doesn't cut it since what works for others might not work for you. By dialing in the ideal restful position just for you, you now can sleep comfortably whether you are sitting straight on an airline seat or resting on a recliner at home. The thermo-sensitive memory foam will mold to your body's natural contours for a custom fit. It helps relieve the tension in your neck and shoulders due to prolonged sitting. Use it on a plane, car, or anywhere you need the extra support for your neck and shoulders. You will definitely like the soft and comfortable feel of this pillow. The cover is made of high-quality, machine-washable velour cover. Built-in elastic strap makes it easy to attach to a carry-on luggage without taking up extra space.

In addition to eliminating the breakable glass carafe, the BrewStation\u00ae Dispensing Coffeemaker with Removable Reservoir simplifies another messy chore: filling the water reservoir. Instead of opening the top of the coffeemaker and pouring in water, which typically involves pulling the coffeemaker forward for better reach, this coffeemaker is equipped with a removable side reservoir that lifts off for easy filling at the sink. The BrewStation\u00ae Coffeemaker with Removable Reservoir means no pouring and no spilling. There\u2019s no need to use either a carafe or a pitcher for messy filling because the water reservoir removes from the side of the unit, allowing for fast, easy access. This cleverly designed reservoir holds enough water to brew multiple cups and is equipped with a water level indicator for filling smaller amounts as well.  This new model of coffee-dispensing convenience by Hamilton Beach\u00ae, the brand that invented the original \u201ccoffeemaker without a carafe,\u201d is the latest in a long line of innovative products. Earning high praise since its debut, the dispensing coffeemaker concept changed the way people enjoy coffee. A quick push of the dispenser bar and coffee is dispensed right into the cup; no breakable glass carafe or messy pouring to contend with. Inside each BrewStation\u00ae tank, a gentle heater maintains the coffee\u2019s temperature without scorching the flavor. From top to bottom, every coffeemaker in the BrewStation\u00ae line delivers the innovation and convenience that coffee drinkers and home cooks have come to expect from the Hamilton Beach\u00ae brand.     Product Feature Benefits   The original 12 cup dispensing coffeemaker invented by Hamilton Beach\u00ae   Brews multiple cups of coffee and dispenses one fresh cup at a time   Forget the carafe\u2122 \u2014 no pouring, no spilling, no breaking and no burnt coffee flavor   No hot plate to scorch coffee\u2019s fresh-brewed flavor   Water reservoir removes for easy filling at the sink   Lets you make coffee the way you always have: just add water, a paper filter and ground coffee   Brews hot or iced coffee   Dedicated ICED COFFEE program button   Versatile brewing options include REGULAR, BOLD and 1-4 CUPS   Programmable timer lets you wake up to fresh, hot coffee   Adjustable auto shutoff is customizable from 0-4 hours    Product Uses  Effortless Brewing and Dispensing The inventive BrewStation\u00ae design took coffee from an outside carafe to an enclosed, interior tank, where coffee stays hot and fresh tasting for a long time. You make coffee the way you always have \u2014 by adding water, a paper filter and ground coffee. On this model, the removable water reservoir expands the convenience even further by letting you fill up at the sink without messy pouring. Best of all, freshly brewed coffee is easily dispensed on cup-at a time by pressing your cup against the dispenser bar for the world\u2019s easiest fill-up.  Brewing Boldly Do you love every nuance of coffee\u2019s complex flavor? Do you grind \u2014 or even roast \u2014 your own beans because you enjoy the difference in freshness? Or if your schedule doesn\u2019t allow for such an indulgence, do you satisfy your cravings by purchasing coffee that was recently roasted? Then try going BOLD. Before you start brewing, select the BOLD option to allow more time for water to saturate the grounds and fully extract your coffee\u2019s rich flavor. The BOLD setting will require additional time to complete a brewing cycle. But if you want a bolder tasting cup of coffee, the extra few seconds of brewing time are worth the wait.  Brewing Iced Coffee  Want delicious iced coffee without having to pay at an expensive coffeehouse or have an inconsistent coffee from the drive-through? The try the ICED COFFEE setting. It\u2019s easy to do. Just fill the reservoir up to the 6-cup line and fill the coffee tank with ice no more than the 10-cup line. Then brew your coffee double-strength. Dispense your delicious iced coffee right into your cup or pitcher, stir in sweetener or flavorings, and add ice.  Mocha Cinnamon Iced Coffee  Try this delicious recipe developed by the pros in the Hamilton Beach Test Kitchen. It makes eight 12-ounce servings that are perfect for on-the-go refreshment or leisurely sipping.    Ingredients:     12 tablespoons ground coffee   \u00bd teaspoon cinnamon   1 \u00bd cups half-and-half   1 cup chocolate syrup   8 cups ice cubes     Directions    Brew iced coffee as directed in the \u201cBrewing Iced Coffee\u201d paragraph above, except add the cinnamon to the ground coffee in the brew basket. For one serving, dispense 8 ounces of coffee into a 12 oz. glass. Add 3 tablespoons half-and-half, 2 tablespoons chocolate syrup and 1 cup ice. Stir and enjoy.  Tips & Care   Before first use, wash the coffee tank, filter basket and drip tray in hot, soapy water. Never put the coffee tank or removable reservoir in the dishwasher. Use coffeemaker cleaner monthly (once a week in areas with hard water) to prevent deposits that adversely affect coffeemaker performance and can decrease the life of your appliance.

You'll taste the difference the first time you use your Roaster Oven. So, start cooking with Nesco. Explore all the ways to get the most out of this special home cooking appliance.  HOW TO USE AND CARE FOR YOUR ROASTER OVEN  1. Unpack your Nesco Roaster Oven completely and remove all packaging material and information labels. Place the Roaster Oven in a well ventilated area on a heat resistant surface. Set the control dial to its minimum setting. Plug the cord into a 120 volt AC outlet. Return control to maximum setting (450-degrees F). Operate the Roaster Oven empty (without the cookwell or cover) for approximately 60 minutes, or until any odor or smoking disappears. Some smoke and odor are a normal part of \"curing\" the element and will not reoccur in cooking use. When curing is completed, turn the temperature control to its lowest setting, unplug the unit from the electrical outlet and allow to cool. 2. Wash the cover, cookwell and rack in warm sudsy water, then rinse and dry. Refer to complete cleaning instructions in manual. 3. Non-stick cookwell: When 'curing' your Roaster Oven with a non-stick cookwell, we recommend that it be operated with cover and cookwell. Do this in a covered outside area or other well-ventilated area. After curing and cleaning, and before cooking in your non-stick cookwell for the first time, lightly coat the interior of the cookwell with vegetable oil.  HELPFUL HINTS Preheat roaster oven for 20 minutes. Roasting meat in your Nesco Roaster Oven keeps it moist and tender. For additional browning, you can add 1 tbsp. browning sauce to oil and brush over skin before roasting.  To sear meat, preheat Roaster Oven at 450-degrees F. Add margarine. Cover, then sear meat for 10 to 15 minutes per side until lightly browned. Stir ground meat once. Time will vary depending on the quantity of meat. Alternative browning method for self-basting turkeys, preheat at 400-degrees F for 20 minutes. Roast bird for 1 hour at 400-degrees F. Reduce heat to 350-degrees using included time chart, 13-18 minutes per pound. During last hour of roasting increase temperature to 400-degrees and remove all excess juices in bottom of cookwell.", "salesrank_2018": "339251"}, "B00AMNA6GI": {"description": "Sweet home collection why choose us? at sweet home collection, we strive to create products using the finest textiles possible at reasonable prices.

It will help protect clothes and valuables from the damaging effects of mold/mildew and moisture rot. It is 100% renewable and needs no power to operate. Just hang the Gurin unit in a closet, or you can place it in other small, enclosed spaces, and it will start to adsorb moisture. There are no batteries required or cords to plug in, the unit works without power. There is an indicator window with special \"moisture meter crystals\" that change from blue (when dry) to pink (when wet) to indicate when the unit needs to be \"renewed\". The unit will adsorb approximately 8-10 ounces of moisture (depending on humidity levels this should take between 6 - 8 weeks). Once the moisture has been adsorbed it cannot leak or spill. This unit uses a specialized, engineered, crystallized silica gel that is odorless, non-toxic and completely safe. When the indicator crystals turn pink it is time to \"re-new\" the unit. Simply remove the unit from where it is adsorbing moisture and plug it into a power outlet or power strip in a well ventilated area (bathroom with extraction fan, garage, outside, etc.). There is a built-in heater that will warm the crystals allowing them to expand and release the moisture as water vapor into the outside air. It takes about 12-14 hours to completely re-new the unit. When it is completely renewed the indicator crystals will change back to blue. The unit is brand new again and ready to adsorb another 8-10 ounces of moisture.

The unit's upper and lower nonstick, removable grill plates provide even grilling and toasting. The integrated drip tray makes it easy to drain grease away from food for healthier cooking. Designed like professional units, its floating hinge adjusts to accommodate any thickness for perfectly grilled thin or thick panini and sandwiches. The present temperature is ideal for grilling and takes the guesswork out of cooking to ensure crisp, golden-brown results. With 'Power On' and 'Ready to Cook' indicator lights, operation is simple. Even more, the GR-11 takes up minimal space and provides just enough surface area to cook for a couple of friends or family members.        Panini Made Easy The word \"panini\" is an Italian term for grilled sandwiches. Panini can include a combination of ingredients such as vegetables, meat and cheese layered between two pieces of freshly baked bread. The sandwich is then pressed between two grill plates to toast the bread and warm the filling. Use your Griddler Grill & Panini Press to grill sandwiches, breads and quesadillas. Tuck your favorite ingredients between artisan breads and press or make grilled sandwiches and crispy traditional panini two at a time.  Experiment with a variety of savory or sweet sandwiches for any meal. We recommend using freshly baked bread to produce the best-tasting panini. Popular breads for panini are focaccia, michette, ciabatta, and thick slices of Italian bread. The Griddler Grill & Panini Press was designed with a unique handle and hinge that allows the cover to adjust to the thickness of the sandwich you are preparing. This allows for even toasting and heating. Light pressure can be applied to the handle to press and heat the sandwich to your liking. When cooking two or more panini, it is important that the thickness of all sandwiches is the same so the cover will close evenly on the panini. Two Ways to Grill The Griddler Grill & Panini Press can also be used as a contact grill to cook burgers, boneless pieces of meat, thin cuts of meat and vegetables. You can easily grill anything with even results, from a thinly-sliced potato to a sirloin steak. The floating hinge adjusts the cover to grill meats on both sides at once. Open flat to grill steaks, veggies and more. The contact grill function works best when you want to cook something in a short amount of time or when you are looking for a healthy method of grilling. When cooked on the contact grill, food will cook quickly because you are grilling both sides of the food at the same time. The ribs on the grill plates combined with the grease spout at the rear of the plates allows the grease to drip from the meat and drain off the plates.       Product Features  Base and Cover Solid construction with a brushed stainless steel self-adjusting cover.  Panini-Style Handle Sturdy cast-metal handle adjusts the cover to accommodate thickness of food.  Removable Grill Plates Nonstick for oil-free options. Dishwasher-safe for easy cleanup.  Indicator Lights Signal 'Power On' and 'Ready to Cook.'  Drip Tray Collects grease and can be removed from the base for easy cleanup.  Plate Release Buttons Push in to release and remove cooking plates.  Hinge Release Button Allows the cover to lie back for cooking in the flat position.  Adjustable Front Feet Tilts the unit to increase grease drainage.  Instruction and Recipe Booklet Included Try out fun recipes for paninis, appetizers, desserts and more.

Yogurt lovers can create an endless variety of flavors and the 1-1/2 liter batch makes enough for days of delicious meals and snacks. Operation is simple. Once processing time has elapsed, the unit switches itself to a cooling mode. Today's health-conscious consumers want to eat right. Not only a great source of protein and calcium, yogurt also contains probiotics, or good bacteria, that are crucial for a healthy digestive system. The Cuisinart Electronic Yogurt Maker takes the guesswork out of making yogurt at home. Simply mix together ingredients and pour into the yogurt container, letting the yogurt maker do the rest. You will love the ready-to-eat chilled results. Either plain or flavored, yogurt is the perfect anytime food to enjoy alone, with granola or in your morning smoothie. Yogurt is also a great ingredient to have on hand in the kitchen for delicious and moist baked goods, as a secret ingredient to marinades for meat and poultry, and also the perfect vehicle for soups and sauces. Product Benefits Large Capacity: Make more than six 8-ounce servings of yogurt at a time in the 50-ounce yogurt container.    Automatic Cooling Mode: The unit switches to cooling mode when the processing cycle is done, and maintains temperature until you turn the unit off. Perfect Results - Automatically: Just add milk or soymilk, active cultures and flavors of your choice; select the time and press START and then watch the CYM-100 do all the work. Simple Operation: Start and stop your yogurt making at the touch of a button. The LED display clearly displays and counts down processing time. The time controls make it easy to set the recommended processing time for the recipe you're using. Stainless Steel Styling: Sleek, elegant and streamlined enough to leave right on the counter.   Operation Instructions     Put all of the ingredients in the yogurt container and then cover it with the yogurt container lid. Place the filled container into the housing and cover with the housing lid. Plug the unit in and the default fermentation time (8 hours) will begin flashing on the screen. To change the fermentation time (1-24 hours), use the \"+\" and \"-\" buttons. Once desired fermentation time is flashing on the LED display, press the START button. At this point, the fermentation numbers on the LED will become solid and fermentation countdown will begin. After the fermentation is complete the unit will automatically switch into cooling mode and display \"C\" in the LED. As long as the unit is plugged in, it will stay in cooling mode until you turn the unit off. After 8-12 hours, the temperature of the yogurt will be between 43 and 52 degrees Fahrenheit. To turn the unit off or end the cooling cycle, press and hold the STOP button for 3 seconds. Once the unit is off, you can either remove the yogurt container and place it directly in the refrigerator, or use the yogurt scoop provided and divide yogurt into individual portions.  Tips and Hints Finished Yogurt and Taste   Longer fermentation times will produce a tangier yogurt, but also aid in thickening. Strain yogurt overnight using a strainer lined with a coffee filter, for an ultra-rich and thick treat. Whole milk is recommended for making yogurt -- avoid ultra-pasteurized milk. Fuller-fat milks produce thicker yogurts. When adding a flavor to yogurt, wait until 6 hours after the cooling process has begun. Flavors can also be added to individual portions as needed instead of to the entire batch. Certain flavors may shorten the shelf life of yogurt. Fruit mix-in flavors last longer and are better added to the entire batch, while sweeter syrups are best added to individual portions. Yogurt will be at its best and should be eaten within the first three days after completion. Yogurt can be kept for up to 8 days.

They\u2019re great for stairs and other surfaces like curtains, upholstery, auto interiors, and more. What are the benefits to cleaning with the BISSELL Zing Bagged Canister Vacuum?  BISSELL Zing bagged canister vacuum makes any cleaning task seem effortless. The lightweight design and carry handle provide portable convenience. The Multi-Surface Floor Nozzle allows for easy cleaning of carpet, rugs and bare floors. The telescoping wand allows you to comfortably maneuver around and under furniture and also clean hard to reach areas like drapes and ceilings. When you are finished, the cord will automatically rewind with the push of a button. What is the difference between an upright vacuum and a canister vacuum? Canister vacuums are low to the ground vacuums that have a long hose with a wand on the end. As you clean through the hose and wand, you pull the canister unit behind you. Upright vacuums stand tall and have a handle, which is used to push the vacuum. When cleaning carpets, the debris is removed through the foot or base of the unit. Most uprights also have a hose and on-board tools, which are typically used for hard to reach places and when cleaning furniture.At one time, canisters were thought to be easier to use for cleaning hard to reach places and for cleaning a larger variety of floors surfaces. However, the uprights of today have added cleaning features, such as bare floor height adjustments, brush roll on/off switches, and are easily maneuverable. In addition, the on board cleaning tools have made upright vacuums even more versatile.Although uprights are easier to use and more effective at cleaning larger areas in the home, they can still be a challenge when cleaning stairs.        Which type of vacuum is better -- bagless or bagged? Neither type of vacuum is \u201cbetter\u201d than the other. A bagged vacuum will lose its cleaning effectiveness as the bag fills with debris. The bag must be changed when it is about 1/2 to 2/3 full for the best cleaning performance. The choice between a bagged and bagless vacuum really depends on your personal preference.

The machine\u2019s cleaner head has an active base place, which self-adjusts automatically for optimal contact with all floor types. On hard floors the base plate lowers to create an efficient seal, and the brush bar lifts clear off the floor to protect delicate surfaces. On carpet, the base plate rises and the brush bar lowers for optimum bristle penetration- removing ground-in dirt and pet hair from different depths of carpet pile. And because the cleaner head adjusts automatically, there are no fiddly dials and you don\u2019t need to bend down to make adjustments.   Dyson cyclones capture more dirt than any other cyclone. DC40 Multi floor has Radial Root Cyclone technology with remodeled airflows to maximize suction power. DC40 Multi floor also has patented Ball technology. It turns on the spot, which allows you to maneuver more easily around obstacles and into awkward spaces. And because the motor and other key components are located inside the ball, the machine has a lower center of gravity- making it even easier to steer.  Patented Dyson Technology: Dyson engineers are constantly testing and inventing, trying to find new ways to make their technology better. As they work, they file patent applications to protect their inventions from copycat manufacturers. That\u2019s why the only place you\u2019ll find Dyson technology is inside a Dyson machine.  New Radial Root Cyclone technology Ordinary vacuum cleaners rely on bags to trap dust and dirt. As you use them, the tiny holes in the bag clog up with particles of dust. This restricts the flow of air, so the vacuum cleaner loses suction. Dyson vacuum cleaners don\u2019t rely on bags to trap dust and dirt. They use cyclone technology, which spins the air at incredibly high speeds. The cyclones inside a Dyson vacuum cleaner generate centrifugal forces many thousands of times the force of gravity. Dust, dirt and pet hair are flung out of the airflow and straight into the bin. No bag. No loss of suction.  Dyson has been continually refining cyclone technology since inventing it more than 20 years ago. DC40 Multi floor has new Radial Root Cyclone technology. Reconfigured air channels and improved flow efficiency reduce turbulence and preserve air pressure, so that the inner cyclones can extract more microscopic particles. These refinements help remove more dirt, dust, allergens and pet hair for the airflow.  Ball technology to help you steer with ease Dyson Ball upright vacuum cleaners use patented Ball technology to overcome the steering limitations of fixed wheels. They ride on a ball, which turns on the spot so you can steer with ease, changing direction with just a turn of the wrist.  The ball itself is made of glass-reinforced polypropylene- the same material used in the manufacture of car dashboards. It combines high impact strength with the resistance to distortion. The ball also holds the heaviest component, (the motor), positioned towards the base for a lower center of gravity and greater stability.  DC40 Multi Floor Bundle Product Features: Self-adjusting cleaner head Many upright vacuum cleaners use fixed settings and their cleaner heads don\u2019t self-adjust to different floor types. And the bigger the gap between the cleaner head and floor, the more suction power is wasted. DC40 Multi floor has an active base plate. It creates the optimal cleaner head contact for every floor type, reducing air leaks and retaining suction power on all floor types- wood, carpet, vinyl and tile.  Instant release wand DC40 Multi floor has an instant release, long reach wand for cleaning stairs and awkward areas- it stretches up to 5 times in length. There are no separate parts to assemble.  DC40 Multi floor comes with the following Dyson tools and accessories: Articulating hard floor tool - Pivots 180 degrees to reach hard to reach placesSoft dusting brush - Soft bristles to gently dust around the homeMattress tool - Wide head and lightweight design for easy cleaningFlexi-crevice tool - Brush attachment for tight spaces and dusty cornersCombination tool - Debris nozzle that converts to brush for dustingStair tool - Remove dirt and dust from corners and against vertical edges of stairs Approved for allergy sufferers All new Dyson upright and canister vacuums are certified asthma & allergy friendly by the Asthma & Allergy Foundation of America. Dyson cyclones capture microscopic particles down to 0.5 microns in size, including pollen, mold and bacteria.  No extra costs Other vacuum cleaners are still designed to need replacement bags and filters- and the cost soon adds up. Dyson vacuums don\u2019t have bags and have washable filters, so there are no extra costs..  5 year parts and labor warranty Your Dyson vacuum cleaner is likely to take a few knocks and bashes during everyday use- but that\u2019s nothing compared to what Dyson puts its machines through during testing and development. All Dyson vacuum cleaners undergo a lengthy and rigorous testing program. That\u2019s why DC40 Multi floor comes with a 5 year warranty- parts and labor guaranteed by Dyson.

Mesh Produce Bags help eliminate the need for plastic bags and are great for both produce shopping and storage. The 1/8-inch square mesh fabric is highly stretchable, allows for easy identification of contents and provides excellent air circulation, great for pantry storage of thick-skinned produce like potatoes and onions. You can hang full bags on hooks by the drawstring for extra pantry space. Mesh bags work well for refrigerator storage of thick skinned produce like apples, oranges and cucumbers. Refrigerators dehumidify the air to prevent frost buildup, so we do not recommended storage of delicate produce that easily wilts, like lettuce and greens, in a mesh bag. Consider our Organic Cotton Muslin Produce Bags for that task. Mesh bags are also multipurpose net bags for laundering delicate items, transporting small beach items, glass bottle protection, hanging storage bags (on wall hooks), organization bags and many more jobs! Easy to care for, just wash in cold water, smooth out wrinkles and line or flat dry. While you can expect about 10% shrinkage on the first wash, the mesh material will stretch out to nearly the prewashed size when filled again. Made of organic cotton, they bring tremendous benefits to the environment and our health by avoiding the highly toxic pesticides and chemicals, and they're NATURAL, SUSTAINABLE, BIODEGRADABLE and REUSABLE for many years.
