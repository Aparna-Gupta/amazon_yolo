       " 'B003G2ZL4E': {'Best review': \"Impressions begin at first site, and I drew my first impression before it was even out of the box.  The box was large, holding a fully assembled ottoman, and it was packed with care.  The cardboard was thick and sturdy.  I opened it from the bottom side so that I could slip the box off the top.  The feet were wrapped in bubble wrap, and there was thick foam padding protecting it further from the stress of transportation.  I gently turned it over and lifted the box from the ottoman.  There was more cardboard to remove, revealing a drawstring slipcover that helped protect the leather from rubbing against the cardboard.  It untied easily to reveal the ottoman.I'm not sure what I expected, but I felt pleasantly surprised!  The BEST Cambridge Leather Storage Ottoman is well constructed and feels very sturdy.  The padded top is very comfortable and just the right height to rest my feet on, but it is also super soft for sitting.  The legs are nicely finished and blend well with the brown color of the leather.The lid raises up on heavy duty hinges that look like they will last a long time and they glide very smoothly.  There are three hinges across the back of the lid, and of course the two side hinges that hold the lid up without allowing it to slam shut.The inside is lined in a black fabric, and the seams are well hidden.  The lining fabric doesn't feel heavy duty, though, it feels like it might tear if I'm not careful.  The space inside is very roomy, and the bottom is solid so I don't have to worry about anything being too heavy to put in it.The leather is smooth and soft.  The top is made up of 6 sections, each seamed well together.  There are two tufts in the lid which are screaming for buttons, but there are none.  It doesn't detract from the design though.  The sides appear nearly seamless, with visible seams only on the corners.  The leather is bonded leather, which means there could be multiple pieces of leather which are chemically processed to fuse them together and appear as one piece.  I would have never know if the leather was bonded or even real leather if it weren't for the Amazon product description.  The label on the bottom of the ottoman only disclosed the contents of the padding and lining fabric and made no reference to the leather at all.I'm very, very happy with this ottoman.  It's comfortable, well made, attractive, and offers much needed storage space.  It's great in the living room, but the size would be perfect at the foot of a bed to hold linens.  It's very versatile!\",\n",
       "  'description': 'The Chatham Leather Storage Ottoman is a great way to help you organize your living room in a classic, tasteful fashion. At first glance, this appears to be similar to many other ottomans...however, the Chatham hides a unique secret. It offers internal storage space, like many ottomans, with the exception that it features a drawer instead of a lifting lid.    The storage drawer is ideal for books, magazines, and especially remote controls. If you&#x2019;re tired of items like these constantly cluttering your otherwise pristine setting, then place this ottoman in your home and show everyone--especially your husband--where things are to be placed from that point forward. The drawer is spacious, and provides ample space, all at just an arm length away! The drawer features no knobs or handles, enabling it to seamlessly blend in with the hardwood side paneling of the ottoman. It can be easily opened by pulling the bottom edge.    When you&#x2019;re not using the drawer, you will appreciate the luxurious, rich grade of leather used for the top of this great piece. Bonded, espresso brown leather is painstakingly upholstered, with a total of six tufts on the top, to perfectly fit the hardwood frame. Beneath this highly desired exterior lies advanced padding that will hold its shape for many years--even if you decide to convert the ottoman into a new home for your aching feet.',\n",

I\\'ve purchased two as gifts and every year the recipients comment about how their favorite sheets don\\'t leave their beds, except for day-time washings, during the winter months.These sheets are a step below the Pinzon 190 gram sheets and the price is a bit less to compensate.  Sure, they are still warm and soft and haven\\'t pilled but they aren\\'t quite the fluffy goodness of the 190 gram.  Frankly, if you have the money, buy the 190 gram.  If not, these are still quite good and are not a huge step down from the 190 gram sheets like the 160 gram... those are just your run-of-the-mill big box store \"flannel.\"As for the color, and this is never fair to online sellers because monitor screen colors can vary so much, my screen is showing a lighter blue than what was received. If I had to rename the color, I would call it \"Light Denim\" to reflect the color it actually is.  It looks more like a \"Sky Blue\" on my screen.

I had already ordered another \"Sharp Electronics AFS80RX Energy Star 8,000 BTU 115-Volt Window-Mounted Air Conditioner with Rest Easy Remote Control\" from Amazon before I called.  Amazon even allowed me to keep the old one till the new one got here.  This is more like it.  It cost about $20 more than the Frigidaire, but has digital controls and a remote.  The fan makes less noise on high than the old one did on low.  It keeps the room a constant temp. and has energy saver for at night when I just want to keep it cool enough to cool down easily when I need it.  This just plain works better.  I am sure that if I had bought a Frigidaire with the same features I would be just as happy, but as it worked out this was the best bang for the buck.  I think the things are made at the same place as I used the window pieces off of the old one and sent the new ones back with the old unit to make resale easier for Amazon, they were identical.

       " 'B0044EPOKE': {'Best review': \"After spending time over several weeks reading reviews on Steam Mops, it's clear that the manufacturers need to do some work.  There were so many poor reviews in every product line, it was hard to find any product that didn't have scathing reviews.  I found this one on other sites with good reviews so thought I would give it try.If my son had not accidentally thrown the box away, I would have returned it.Pros - It does clean well.  The steam is hot.  It leaves the floor wet but dries quickly.But what you have to fight to get there is not worth it.Cons: Almost everything- You have to hold the handle down for the steam to come out - I rigged it with a strong rubber band as it tired my hands out.- The cord is just not long enough and there is not a cord clasp to keep it out of your way as you are cleaning.  The bottom cord holder is so far down on the handle that when you try to wrap the cord around it, you hit the body of the machine.- The plug is weighted heavily so the slightest movement and out it comes - I tried pushing the prongs apart but that didn't help so now I plug it into a power strip - isn't that fun?- The Accessory kit won't stay on if the machine is at a stand still much less in movement.  Really?  They couldn't figure out to fasten a plastic carrier on?- Hard to push.  I keep looking down to see if the wheels are really moving since pushing this thing is like pushing rubber across carpet.  I'm going to try a microfiber cloth and see if that helps.- It runs out of water just cleaning my small kitchen.- When I pull the water tank stopper out, the whole rubber plug comes out.  So I have to ever sooooo gently pull it and hold the other part down to keep that from happening.- There are a lot of tools but seriously, I'm not going to use them so it's a waste.  I did pull it out to use as a hand held model but I could not see any difference in the cleanliness of the sink so who wants to drag the thing around.I'm using it because I paid for it and I don't want it go to waste -- but I feel foolish getting stuck with this machine.\",\n",

The heat type have their own separate set of problems,not addressed here as this is not that type of unit.This means two things:1) They need complete cleaning regularly2) They need new \"filters\" (actually moisture wicks) regularlySo this unit does work and gets the room it is in reasonably moist.The unit is able to raise the humidity by about 5-20 percent. 20 close to the unit,5 further away. It is way too noisy on the high setting, quite nice on the low setting,OK on the middle setting as long as you do not need to be in that room for a long time.I have found that after about 2-4 weeks the filters will need to be replaced so factor thatinto your cost.A big tissue is that as with way too many products, this (and I suspect most alternatives)have lots of nooks and crevices and crannies that are a total pain to clean very well. If youwant to get this unit really clean, plan to take it outdoors, use a high pressure hose on thenon-electrical parts, and partially disassemble the fan housings (thereby involving electricalparts so be sure you know what you are doing). A complete clean can take 45 minutes to an hourof work but you will not get it clean without the effort. Also plan to do this every 2-4 weeks.Bottom line, works OK but is a pain to maintain. OTOH, I doubt the alternatives are much eaiser- just a fact of life with humidifiers.Update: I have stopped using this on reccomendation of my pulmunologist. He says that this typecan spew fungus into the air. In addition, after checking the humidity in an adjacent room withit running and then again after not using it for two weeks (similar weather, BTW), there was onlyabout 4-5 percent difference in humidity.

In terms of weight, comfort, and durability - the comforter can't be beat.  I cannot say the same for this duvet cover set.  In reading the reviews I see that many customers find the colors and embossing (snakeskin) unpleasant, and I am among them.  What I received was not the cool, crisp, clean white shown in the photos but a warm yellow white like old linens that have been stored in the attic.  The fabric is stiff rather than soft and heavy rather than light like other microfiber duvet covers I've owned, and it wrinkles terribly in the dryer. I have washed it and re-washed it and set my timer to shake it out every 5 minutes while it was drying, and it is still a wrinkled mess at the end of the cycle.  Nothing short of ironing works to eliminate the wrinkles.  The shams are too large for every queen size pillow I own and look sloppy even after ironing.  The flanges are skimpy (@ 1&#34;) and trimmed with satin piping.  The sewing thread was not well-suited to the fabric so it shrank but the fabric didn't, and the result is a puckered mess.  I cannot find one positive thing to say about this product except that it arrived promptly.

The directions also draw the Pre/Charcoal filter as being about 1/3 as thick as the Hepa Filter and they write about it in what I think is a misleading way(page E-5 in the manual). This \"Pre-/Charcoal Filter\" as they call it is simply a thin, very thin, layer of foamy like substance (I\\'ll take their word for it about the Charcoal) that uses a velcro-like strip at the top to attach to the HEPA. Then they number the filters like this:1. Pre-Filter combined with2. Charcoal Filter3. Hepa FilterSo I was looking for a 3rd item. You can stop looking.  It\\'s that thin foamy thing that they\\'re \"wordsmithing\\' to sound more important that it looks.

The vacuum can be used standing up or remove the hand held vac for complete light cordless cleaning. This is a huge issue when you are older, to be able to hold a vacuum that doesn't kill your wrist and not get your legs or feet twisted up in a long cord when balancing on stairs. This also comes with one attachment- a tiny brush- very handy for lifting the low nap in car carpets. The most important thing to remember is to clean the dirt cup and filter after every use- the filter is so tiny, that cleaning it makes it perfect for the suction you will need for your next use.What used to take us 15 minutes to vacuum the stairs now takes 5 minutes with such a light weight and cordless easy to use hand vac. We charge it after every 2 uses and have had no issues ever. Dirt Devil has a one year warranty, as with our other heavy corded Power Reach, but we know they last way longer, as that vacuum has passed it's decade mark already and still runs like new.  For it's light weight and great cleaning when you keep the cup and filter clean, it deserves 5 Stars. If it lasts as long as our Dirt Devil Power Reach, it will deserve 10 Stars. It's just wonderful to have a vacuum that saves an older person's knees and back bending up and down steps in a much shorter time too, and for that alone I would give it 5 Stars.\",\n",

But, I was a bit lost as to exactly to what degree they were improving the air quality in my house...I had no way of really knowing. I also found the filter replacement times somewhat vague. You replace them based on keeping track of how many hours you have run your air cleaner at a given fan speed--the higher the fan speed, the fewer total hours of run time until you need to change each filter. This does not seem like the best way of knowing when to replace these costly items.Doesn't it make sense that if there is not so much dust in your house, but a lot of dust in someone else's house, that running an identical air cleaner for the same amount of time and fan speed as the people in the other house is going to mean that your filters are not going to be plugged up as quickly as theirs? And, in order to save energy on the electric bill, how do I know what is the lowest fan speed to use to actually keep my air clean, given the size of my room and the actual dust that it contains or that flows into the room from doors and windows?I started doing some research online and eventually came across this device.I bought one of these Dylos air quality monitors and now that I am using it, I couldn't imagine running good air cleaners without one. It gives you an immediate readout of the quantity of particles floating around in your air, and a scale to tell you what that means. It allows you to see what is going on in your room, with your air cleaner, with your dust problem at this moment as it is affected by the outside air currents, etc.. This will make it possible to determine the best fan speed, and also allows you to tell the condition of your filters by measuring the clean air output of your air cleaner. You replace your filters when they are not filtering properly anymore, not when some arbitrary timer tells you to. I can move the Dylos from room to room to check, as it is small and light.For the small cost of this device relative to electric costs and filter costs, it is a steal in the long run. I have no affiliation with Dylos. They have been well reviewed elsewhere and make the most reasonable particle counter on the market. It works for me, and I just thought I'd pass it along.\",\n",

       " 'B00GXFIS5A': {'Best review': 'I approached this Dyson DC58 handheld with a combination of anticipation and skepticism.That\\'s because I own an earlier model Dyson handheld, the DC34. That handheld was excellent when it worked. But it suffered from very short battery life from the day it was new (5-7 minutes max) and, after a few months, started to manifest a problem where the vacuum would only operate for a few seconds between trigger activations. As I subsequently learned, this was a common problem.So, while I really liked the DC34 initially, I grew to dislike it immensely over time. In fact, before I got this DC58, I\\'d switched to a reasonable mid-line Black and Decker model. It never picked up dirt like the Dyson did at its best. But it also didn\\'t give me any troubles and held a charge much longer.OK, enough back story. How is this new DC58 model?In terms of addressing the biggest out-of-the-box problem with the earlier model--short battery life--they\\'ve done something very clever here. Basically, they now offer the user two power step operation. In the lower power mode, the battery lasts 15-20 minutes. In high power mode (Dyson calls it \"Boost Mode\"), you are back to the old 5-7 minutes of operation. The key here, though, is that for many/most cleaning operations, the lower power mode is perfectly fine. In fact, after testing out both modes, I pretty much stuck to the lower power mode for all my subsequent cleaning tests. The only place where I had to switch back into Boost Mode was to clean some junk out from a narrow crack between the seats in my car. I couldn\\'t get the nozzle far enough down to pull the stuff in using the standard mode, but in boost mode, the suction pulled everything through the air the small extra distance necessary.Generally, this Dyson, like other Dyson vacuums, demonstrates a clear advantage over cheaper brands in terms of being able to maintain very good suction even as it fills up. With my Black and Decker, for example, I am continually having to open the vacuum up to clean the filter--often in the middle of a job--because the suction is deteriorating. No such problems with the Dyson.Cleaning (open the canister, dump into your garbage) is about the same as the old Dyson handheld, and is better than, say, my Black and Decker (due to less problems with the filter getting clogged and needing cleaning). The attachment set is minimal, just like my previous handheld Dyson. But, to be honest, I only use the straight extender wand anyway.So Dyson has won me back to the fold. Whether I remain there depends on whether the battery/electrical system on this one stays the course long term. I am hoping that the obvious implementation of changes to the power system (two speeds) suggests they\\'ve addressed other issues as well.',\n",

Maybe once I get my house to where I vacuum each room each week, it won't be so bad.  But as it stands now I spend about 3 minutes cleaning it out each time I use it.

I have to take them up off the floor every time I vacuum.  The guide says to fold the fringe under, but that doesn't cut it.  The Roomba just thinks it's furniture and doesn't go up on it.  Basically even the mats in the bathroom and welcome mats need to be taken up off the floor every time you vacuum a room.Something else I have noticed is that you do need a hand vacuum for small spills if you don't want to haul out the Roomba.  You also need one for the stairs.  But I haven't vacuumed the stairs in two years, so the Roomba takes care of most of my vacuuming needs.

Thirteen inches in diameter and lighter than your average bowling ball, this innovative vacuum roams the room devouring dust, dirt, and tidbits left behind from everyday living.Setting up your Roomba for its first sashay through the living room is fairly easy. You'll want to move any clothing, papers, cords, and fragile items off the floor before you start. You may choose to set up the Virtual Wall unit, which emits a beam to redirect the Roomba, keeping it out of unwanted areas. Make sure the rechargeable battery is fired up by checking the indicator light, set the Roomba in the center of the room, and press the corresponding button for a small (10 by 12 feet), medium (14 by 16 feet), or large (15 by 20 feet) room. When Roomba starts cleaning, it travels around the floor in a spiral pattern. When its bumper touches a wall, Roomba follows the wall for a short time, utilizing its spinning side brush to move objects away from the wall and into the vacuum's path. Then Roomba crosses the room in straight lines. It repeats this pattern until its cleaning time has elapsed, providing maximum cleaning coverage.Although it may look more like a Frisbee than a vacuum, the Roomba cleans carpet, wood, linoleum, and tile, and comes with many of the usual vacuum accoutrements. The agitator brush roll picks up large debris, sucking it into the removable particle bin with filter. An edge-cleaning brush helps get into corners and angular areas. All the brushes and compartments can be removed for regular cleaning maintenance, and the unit comes with two replacement filters. Additional Virtual Wall units, battery packs, and a rapid charger can be purchased separately. The Roomba is covered by a 90-day parts and labor warranty.--Rhonda Langdon\",\n",

       " 'B004H1NICU': {'Best review': 'This is my second Dirt Devil bagged canister and at only nine pounds, a much lighter weight model than the one I presently use. It has several nice features, not the least of which is a cute floral design on the hard plastic case. The wand extends with a press of a lever, and another lever on the floor attachment switches it from carpet to floor mode. Also, the 5 1/2-inch wheels move fairly easily along both carpet and bare floors. There is a variable suction switch that allows some degree of suction, however, my experience was that it needed to be set to the highest suction to be effective. A built-in handle makes this easy to carry and a decent choice for a small apartment or dorm. As for a larger house, the unit is a bit on the underpowered side to be truly effective.The Dirt Devil comes with one canister bag installed and two more provided, however, they are small and will require frequent changing. Packages of three (Type O) bags are available through Amazon. A tiny crevice tool and dusting brush are included. The crevice tool is useful for tight areas and both store conveniently on the wand. The 20-foot cord retracts into the canister with the press of a button mounted on top. Also mounted on top is the ON/OFF switch which can be hand or foot operated. Also, there are two filters, a pre-motor filter and an exhaust filter that can be removed to wash.I found the carpet/floor attachment to deliver only minimal cleaning, better on bare floors than carpets where a beater type attachment is needed. The unit seems to be solidly built, just not as heavy duty as I require for my 4,000+ square-foot, mostly carpeted, house but perfect for a starter home with minimal square footage. My score: 3.5.',\n",

The LED light can't be turned off, so I had to do a little frontier medicine and remove the LED entirely. The loss of the LED doesn't affect the air purificer function whatsoever though.The &#34;whooshing&#34; sound it makes is relaxing, but unless you use purified water, the funnel and bowel will be discolored and acquire a grainy texture from the minerals in the water. It works great even with the discoloration, so I don't really bother using purified water myself, but it's something to keep in mind. You have to clean and refill the bowl every 2-3 days if you leave it on 24-7.

There was a lot to unwrap in this box.  I got it put together without using the instructions.  It comes with a lot of little parts for a variety of jobs, which is nice.  The mop itself has a telescoping pole and loops for cord wrapping.  The cord is nice and long and the unit does heat up instantly, which is a huge bonus!  The dial tells you where to set it for various jobs: fabric being the lowest, then mop, all the way to handheld which is the highest.  The difference between the lowest and highest settings seems to be how fast the steam comes out. I am unsure if the temperature is actually higher or not.When I was done mopping, the velcro attached cleaning pad was hot to the touch. I am not sure how well the velcro will fare in the washing machine.  The pad only slipped a little bit while mopping; not enough to stop and adjust.I prefer a triangle shaped head over a rectangle one, but this one got in the corners \"ok\".  The steam did not do a great job getting down in the grout, nor on the edges of the pad. It did slightly better on the highest heat, but runs out of water quicker that way, of course.  If you want something light and small to do a wide variety of jobs, this will probably be a great unit.  For floors, not my favorite.

       "  'description': 'Indoor air pollution is a very serious problem. According to The U.S. EPA, \"air within homes and other buildings can be more seriously polluted than the outdoor air in even the largest and most industrialized cities.\" Common sources of indoor air pollution include: Radon, Environmental Tobacco Smoke (ETS), Biological Contaminants, Stoves, Fireplaces, Household Products, Formaldehyde, Pesticides, Asbestos, and Lead. To make things worse, Americans now spend 90 percent of their time indoors. Constantly breathing polluted indoor air imperils our health and even dampens our spirits. Fortunately there is a solution . . . Ionization. Ionization works by generating negative ions to counteract pollutants. The negative ions bind to positively-charged unwanted particles, reversing their polarity so they drop to the nearest surface or are neutralized. Negative ions increase oxygen intake and stimulate alertness and vitality, like breathing mountain air. The ionizers developed and manufactured by Wein Products are the Gold Standard in air ionizers. Since 1967, Wein Products has been the leading innovator of this technology. Their products have been tested in hundreds of scientific tests worldwide, and have received commendations from Ground Zero Museum, U.S. Department of Justice, Los Angeles Police Department Bomb Squad, British Ministry of Defense and countless others during the many years in production. In only the first hour of use, the VI-2500 has been shown to remove over 98% of harmful airborne particles, and it will virtually eliminate 100% of airborne contaminants with continued use. Costing only pennies a month to operate, and using less than 6 watts of electricity, the VI-2500 emits the highest available ion output, 450 trillion per second, and removes particles as small as .01 micron, about 40,000 times smaller than the period at the end of this sentence. The VI-2500 has been proven to be least 4 times more effective than comparable units.',\n",

Certain cosmetics such as facial care products, creams, makeup, and makeup removers contain chemical acids and/or bleaches which can discolor fabric. These chemicals do not dissolve in water and may cling to the fabric when wiped against the skin, leading to a discoloration that appears as spots or splotches. Generally, it's best to use a towel or cloth with white fabric when removing facial creams and similar products from the face.

I put it in the bathtub and it just stuck like glue and has not moved an inch. When removing it to clean the tub, you really have to put a little muscle to get it to remove because it suctions that good to the tub.

I was foolish enough to get a Hover when I got my own place.  I hated that machine so much, I had to schedule vacuuming my house, to force myself to do it.  My husband  vacuumed when he really wanted to make me feel spoiled.I have been looking for a good affordable machine.  I read all the reviews before ordering this machine.  I was skeptical.  Before using the animal, I vacuumed my whole house with the Hover.  I was surprised when I vacuumed with the animal, that I had to empty the canister twice.  It does such a good job that I no longer keep throw rugs in front of my cat's litter pans.With my Hover my husband only needed to change the bag twice a year.  Now when he comes home from work, I show off the huge mounds of cat hair and dust in the trash can.  He loves not having to mess with the bags.  I was afraid that I would be driven crazy by the strange color of the machine, but it has grown on me.The machine is so easy to use.  I can clean my whole house very quickly and never break a sweat.  My cats don't care for the animal, because even months after the new has worn off, I am still running it around the house at the least provocation.I found it works on all surfaces including my area rugs.  You have to be careful around the corners of the rugs, but if you run it from the middle of the rug to the corners it works so well, you won't have to take the rugs to the cleansers so often.  All my area rugs are thick wool, so I can't really report on how it works on thin rugs.\",\n",
       "  'description': \"Early Adopters Pick: October 2002. The world&#x92;s only true cyclonic vacuum, generating 100,000 g of centrifugal force and pulling dirt into an indestructible canister made from the same material used for crash helmets.Named for both its power and its ruthless approach to pet hair problems, the Dyson DC07 Animal upright is a piece of engineering wizardry designed by James Dyson, the inventor of cyclonic vacuums. A hit in Europe for years, Dyson vacuums are new to the American market. At the center of the machine's innovation is the Cyclone air path design, an eight-section chamber that creates powerful, consistent suction. The conical chambers generate 100,000 g of centrifugal force, pushing dust and dirt out of the airflow into the vacuum's 1-gallon collection cup. With no bag to clog, the vacuum's 270 air watts of suction remain steady. The large, transparent collection cup is easy to check and empties tidily--pop it off, hold it over a trash bin, and pull the trigger to release dirt without having to touch it. The DC07 also comes equipped with a multipart filtration system to improve overall air quality in the home. The HEPA filter, measuring 412 square inches in surface area, traps microscopic particulates and allergens. Expertly built, the filter is designed to last the lifetime of the machine.Suitable for bare floors and carpets, the Dyson upright features a 14-inch cleaning path and edge-cleaning bristles. A foot pedal switches off the brush roll for bare floors, and the nozzle automatically adjusts for various carpet heights. For above-floor cleaning, the vacuum also comes with a cleverly stowed, 17-foot quick-release hose with a reversible extension-wand handle. Onboard accessories include a crevice tool, a dusting brush, an upholstery attachment, and the Animal turbo tool. Designed for lint and stubborn pet hair, the turbo tool features an air-powered brush bar to extract hair from furniture, stairs, pet beds, cars, and other tight spaces.Made from the same material used in crash helmets, the vacuum is unquestionably durable. Plus, the design only puts 4 pounds of weight on the handle, so pushing and turning is easy. This model comes with a 35-foot power cord and a limited two-year household warranty. It also includes a carpet care kit--a canister of Groom Zorb odor-absorbent carpet cleaning powder and a bottle of Dyzolv spray for spills and stains. Furthermore, Dyson upright vacuums are the first and only vacuums certified asthma friendly by the Asthma and Allergy Foundation.--Emily Bedard\",\n",

The chief concern with a unit of this type is ozone production.  Ozone is *bad* for you.  This unit is *the* best rated unit for ozone production and its ozone levels are very safe -- *IF* the unit is properly serviced.What the manual doesn't tell you -- if you smell ozone you need to clean the element.  You will need to clean the element a lot.  If you cant/won't do that, this is not the air cleaner you are looking for.The second problem with the manual is the cleaning directions are frankly harmful.  The manual says to use dish detergent.  The dish detergent will react with the aluminum and over a long enough time line turning the element black.  This deposit will act like a dielectric (just like the dirt the element collects naturally) and the thing will spew out ozone. Once this had happened I could not get the element clean again and had to replace it.I suggest you clean the element in your dishwasher, with *no* soap and no jet dry.  Fill the soap bucket with pure white vinegar and do a light wash.  It will come out sparkling clean and so far mine has not changed colors -- sometimes simple is better.  Vinegar is a natural aluminum cleaner.  Do *NOT* add cream of tartar or baking soda (this is a common aluminum cleaning recipe) -- this will get baked on to the element and it will *never* come off.  Ask me how I found out? :-)Lastly, the element is a very standard Honeywell element.  You can purchase one for around $125 from online HVAC sites should yours become soiled or damaged (the part # is stamped on the side of the element).\",\n",

Well, I received mine the other day and immediately noticed it's a lot larger than the picture suggests. With that said, definitely measure.First issue encountered was trying to find an appropriate spot. This thing isn't functional enough to fit anywhere... I couldn't place it in a cabinet because the doors wouldn't close properly (the design of this thing is slightly bulky and uneven, so you may not get a proper door close once it is mounted). So, I ended up placing it under the bottom cabinet, meaning it is hanging out the bottom of the cabinet in plain sight, which leads me to my second issue.. It is unsightly. The design is not slim or sleek, but rather it's somewhat bulky and obstructing. When it comes to the kitchen, the more hidden unnecessary items are, the better. It isn't in my favor to walk into my kitchen and see it hanging out from the bottom of my cabinet. Some might consider that a petty argument against the product, to which I would somewhat agree, but ultimately I would like to get what I expect out of a product.I have this product 3 stars because it does work (for the most part) as advertised, but the likelihood of it actually functioning well with a cabinet is to be considered.\",\n",

The cotton is just soft enough to take the edge off the chill without being too clingy.

They wash well as well - although I will say that they do need to be removed promptly to avoid a lot of wrinkles.

For some reason the steam only seemed to work when the iron was vertical rather than horizontal, so I'd iron a piece of sheet and then stand the iron up and a massive jet of steam would puff out into the air.... useless.Over the last 3 months it has started to leak from the handle down onto my hand no matter how full it was.  Useless.Then today it started making a random clicking/sparking noise and the light has been flickering on and off.  My last iron exploded in sparks and smoke so I'm not taking any chances with this one, it's going in the trash and I'll have to waste yet MORE money on another iron.

       " 'B00B1SNMYG': {'Best review': \"Just received this heater. Paid $51. with shipping for it from a reputable source with 30 day returns. Looked it over and have it running full tilt currently. My impression is that it is worth a few bucks more than some of the cheaper plastic heaters. It's about all steel on the exterior and heavy to be so small- very small. Like the rest, it's made in China but it looks fairly well made. It has a tilt shut off safety that kills the power when the unit tilts about 45 degrees or more to the front or rear but not when it tilts to either side. Claims to also have a thermal safety. Seems to be putting out plenty of intense heat at 1500 watts. It's fan forced heat so it does make the typical noise of a fan forced heater... If you want something quiet, get an oil filled radiator type space heater (my favorite type for safety). It's UL LISTED. If it should fail or act up, will update this review.Jan 22, 2011, Due to its small size, the outer metal housing does get fairly hot in places. Would not place it on a flammable surface other than wood or tile, etc. It's still working fine. The thermostat control is sensitive when it's running hard and hot on the high setting. Sometimes it will turn off and on too rapidly. Otherwise, it works fine.Summer 2012: My only complaint is that the thermostat control is somewhat hypersensitive- it will cycle the heater off and on fast sometimes when it gets the room warm. It still gets the job done. Per the reviews I read before this purchase, one should be prepared to return this heater if he receives a bad one. Think a lot of the negative reviews are simply bogus.Upped my rating from 3 to 4 stars. Would buy another one like this if I needed it.Jan 2013: Purchased another one for 51.29 with shipping. May get another RV in the future. Two of these heaters would be just right for a smaller RV to avoid using onboard LP gas... The thermostat on the second one is somewhat sensitive like the first one but they put out heat. When it's cold, that's what matters. The thermostats just cycle off and on more rapidly than most portable heaters.March 2013: Purchased a third one. Therefore, this must be a decent heater in my picky opinion. They are versatile little heaters that don't take up much space. Upped my rating from four stars to five. It's a good little heater. Being so small is an appealing factor to me. Saw the thermal safety work once on the first one I bought. Had the airflow blocked partially. The red caution light came on and the heater shut down to cool...Have them rigged to use in whatever rooms are occupied so it'll be toasty only where needed while maintaining the overall home at a lower, more energy efficient temperature.Oct 25, 2013: Just ordered a fifth one. Haven't received a defective one yet. Being that the thermostat is located near the heating element, that has some effect on the operation of the thermostat control.These little fan forced heaters heat up the air in a room more quickly but my favorite space heater for leaving on night and day inside a home is still a quiet, oil filled, radiator type space heater. Can sit a pot of water on top of them (on the models with a flat top) to add moisture to the air when the humidity drops too low. My respiratory system is able to quickly tell when the air gets too dry.\",\n",

From the original bamboo cutting board company, Totally Bamboo, this dish rack utensil holder is a beautiful and functional addition to any kitchen.  Bamboo is the natural alternative for all things wood. It is the fastest growing plant on our planet and does not require any special care to grow. In fact, it is a grass that produces more oxygen than a hard wood forest of comparable size, it helps to reduce carbon dioxide gases blamed for global warming, and it helps to prevent soil erosion through its widespread root system and large canopy. At Totally Bamboo, we are proud to say we use only the highest quality bamboo, harvested at the optimum age of 5 years from our own bamboo forests.  There are over 1200 species of bamboo; however, we choose to use &#x201C;Moso&#x201D; timber bamboo for its strength, density and versatility.  As an added bonus, it is not a habitat for pandas. Our factories adhere to a very stringent protocol for curing and processing the bamboo, ensuring the highest quality product.

Our goal is continuous improvement through design, developing new, unique and innovative products which appeal to the environmentally conscious.\",\n",

       " 'B00AFRZP9O': {'Best review': \"First of all, I have to say that this desk is a pleasant surprise.  It looks just as good as it does in the picture!Now with that being said, a lot of people are calling it flimsy and weak.  Well duh, you don't sit on this thing.  It's pretty sturdy, it can hold over 100 lbs, but not if that 100 lbs is rocking and swaying.  But its pretty strong for how light it is.  Most of the strongest desks that you can sit on weigh over 300+ lbs and I don't like dealing with all that weight.I've had to finally replace my old desk made by the same company after five years with it.  Not because it finally broke.  No, it was still strong and sturdy as ever.  But it was mostly because it was starting to peel after years of abuse and leaving liquids on the surface.  It was actually smaller than this one that they are currently selling, but unfortunately they don't sell that anymore.  I bought this desk even after all the negative reviews and wow I can say that I am pleasantly surprised.Pros:-  The finish looks great.-  All the pieces fit.-  Assembly is easy, just look at the pictures!-  Packing is superb, very nice protection during shipping!-  Extra hardware just in case you loose some-  You don't really need 2 people to build it, I just lean some parts on the wall if I have to while building.-  Very spacious!-  Super affordable-  Very light for a computer desk-  Can fit a screen of up to 30 inchesCONS:-  Can fit a screen of up to 30 inches only, and no more.  But that is only under the hutch.  If you want to put a bigger monitor on, it can certainly support it, just on other side of the L.I put my books, monitor, fresh pizza, mp3 player and speakers on this desk and it has NO trouble holding all that weight.  What do people who complain about the flimsiness do?  Have sex on it?  I write on it, type on it, lay my head and arms on it sometimes and it works just fine!  Yes its going to vibrate easier than those 300lb desks (or 500lb if they have a hutch!) though, which I expected.  This is a great desk for those who don't want to spend too much money and don't need to have sex/dance on a computer desk.\",\n",

(see my full review there)In comparison, the Bissell is much heavier and unwieldy, both to lug up and down stairs, to fill and empty, and to clean after using. The scrub brushes are like the beater brush on a vacuum, which is difficult if you have pets. Even with vacuuming prior to cleaning, the pet hair can clog up the Bissell cleaning brush, necessitating stopping, taking it apart, etc.The water reservoirs in this model are technically separated, but the clean water is in a plastic water reservoir inside the dirty water tank. Very unpleasant to empty. After using, it was difficult getting all the water out of the carpet cleaner, and there always seemed to be a little dirty water left under the tank that would smell if you didn't heft it into the utility sink and rinse out. I did mention that it's heavy, right?The suction on the Hoover is much better, and in comparison, the Bissell does leave the carpet fairly wet. When it leaves water, it also leaves dirt in the carpet. With pet accidents, you want every little bit pulled out of the carpet!In our opinion, the Hoover is a much better product than the Bissell, and rivals having carpets cleaned professionally.\",\n",

However, it's my fault for not looking at the picture/product description more closely.What is different is that the knobs aren't the same as the Sonoma set. The style is slightly different and I believe they're plastic, rather than metal. Also, the drawers on this are flush with the edges unlike the 6-drawer Sonoma, which has some space on either side that I think makes it look more elegant and matches the set better. The 7-drawer also doesn't have the curvy kickstand.Those are small things that I could live with more easily if the major difference wasn't that the drawers don't have metal gliders. The drawers themselves just have a notch that slides on plastic gliders. Because of this, they do not open and close smoothly, and a couple of the drawers I have to hold the whole unit itself to open and close, they're really tight. I'm hoping a little bit of time will loosen them up slightly. You get what you pay for and I'm not sure the $70 price difference between this and the 6-drawer would be worth it. It is definitely not worth dissembling and returning.What is also different is that while my other Prepac Sonoma products arrived in a timely fashion, this did not. Despite being Prime Eligible, it took 6 business days for shipping, which extended over 2 weekends.On the plus side, it still looks pretty sleek and the size is just what I was looking for.\",\n",

We found them to be warm, comfortable, and nice and large.I'm 6' 2&#34; and my wife is 5' 10&#34;. Many travel blankets are too small for me. Some are too small for her. The Travelrest blanket is larger than most. It covered me comfortably from my trunk to my thighs. It kept me nice and warm for the duration of our 10+ hour flights.Unlike a few other reviewers, I did not have any problems folding the blanket back down to size and fitting it back into the storage pouch. it wasn't quite as neatly packed as the way it came from Travelrest, but it's certainly not overly bulky. It fit into my notebook bag without issues.The material is a soft fleece. No pills in the fabric after several uses--I'll update this review in the future to not how the blanket holds up over time.My three-year-old also loves this blanket. It's great for keeping in the car to throw over him while he rides in his car seat. It finds in the door pocket of our Suburu.Overall this is an excellent, over-sized (or at least larger than most) travel blanket. I'd be happy to recommend it to anyone.5/5 Stars.\",\n",

My cotton clothing looks good after ironing.  It does not get as hot as many irons that are out there.  If you need an iron with a high degree of heat, this is not the iron for you.  I actually like this better (someone else pointed this out in their review) since it makes it much more difficult to scorch what one is ironing.It's light in weight, the pointed back end of the iron makes for MUCH faster ironing, and I love that I can put the iron away in its case while it's still hot (the Japanese manual is much better than the one in English and makes it clear that the iron can be put into its case and stored while it is hot).I only use distilled water in the iron to avoid any calcification problems (we live in a fairly hard water area, but even if we didn't, I wouldn't want to take the risk of clogging up the steam vents over time).  I don't know if it's necessary, but I remove the water reservoir from the iron after I finish ironing.  Given the price per gallon of distilled water, I'd rather not dump the water out (per the instructions) when finished ironing.The bottom line is that this is an almost fun iron to use and it does a good job in getting the wrinkles out.\",\n",

       " 'B000MUUPSA': {'Best review': \"Simplehuman is a great company that produces some extremely interesting products for your home.  They have chosen an unusual product line, which includes items like garbage cans, toilet plungers, soap dispensers, and of course the slim toilet brush.  Well, I guess somebody has to make them, and Simplehuman does a fabulous job.  Not only do they concentrate on making quality products but they have taken great strides in making these everyday items extremely stylish.  These products are things that you would expect to see in homes of the very wealthy, and yet the prices of their products are very affordable.  Still, some may hesitate spending $30 or more dollars on something as simple as a toilet brush.  Well folks, this is no ordinary toilet brush!I can't say enough about the looks of this brush set.  Brushed stainless steel and black have proven to make a stylish look in the kitchen, but who would have thought that this combination would make its way into your bathroom?  Well Simplehuman thought it was a great idea and I must agree.  This toilet brush is slim and sleek, from the easy to remove brush itself to the holder, which has a nice pivot-open door and removable tray (for easy cleaning).  The brush head is replaceable, which is a great feature, but you may have a hard time finding replacement heads.  I buy mine directly from the Simplehuman website, which sells them for $4.99 each.  Not a bad price at all.  If you prefer white instead of stainless steel, Simplehuman sells this same slim toilet brush in white as well.  The brush head has stiff outter bristles, for scrubbing tough stains, while the inner bristles are softer and fuller for regular cleaning.I have gone on and on about how great this toilet brush looks, and yet I only give it a 4-star rating.  Why is this?  Well, as stunning as this brush and holder look, using it is slightly less satisfying; at least at first.  Don't get me wrong, it works quite well, but it takes some getting used to.  As a previous reviewer pointed out, there is no rounded end to this brush, which is fairly custumary on most toilet brushes.  This makes it a little difficult to scrub way down into the drain opening of the toilet bowl.  Also, the brush is quite slim, so you will have to get used to holding the brush for proper scrubbing.  If you hold it wrong the brush will try to turn, which causes the handle to twist in your hand.  Still, after using this brush a few times you quickly learn how to get excellent results.  The stiff outer bristles are great for scrubbing under the rim of the toilet bowl, and the shape of the brush head is designed perfectly for this task.Overall I am very satisfied with my purchase of the Simplehuman Slim Toilet Brush, and I would definately buy it again.  If you are looking for a toilet brush that you won't have to hide away, and you are patient enough to allow yourself to get used to the unique shape and design of the curved brush head, then I would highly recommend this Simplehuman toilet brush.  It truly is the best looking brush and holder set on the market today.  The difficulty of using this brush to clean deep into the drain of the toilet bowl prevents me from giving this set a full 5 stars, but I certainly consider it a 4 and 1/2 star item.  And I can honestly tell you that Simplehuman's customer service staff are extremely friendly and will go the extra mile to make sure you are a satisfied customer.  Give the Simplehuman Slim Toilet Brush a home in your bathroom, and you are sure to receive a lot of compliments from others who visit your loo.  =o)\",\n",

You may experience significant improvement in your spinal alignment between the neck and back. The anatomical shoulder cradle will reduce the body weight impact on the shoulders, increasing blood flow to the arms. The left and right airway system helps to improve breathing.  Side sleeping opens up the airway and prevents snoring due to the larynx remaining open while asleep.  Side sleeping properly may reduce snoring. It also will help with the reduction of migraine headaches that are produced when the sub-occipital muscles in the top of the head cannot relax.  People who sleep with their head propped up often experience headaches in the morning; this is not a coincidence but rather due to the pressure that was forced on the sub-occipital muscles all night.',\n",

In this case, I have many very clear memories of just how poorly various Dirt Devils and Black and Decker cordless vacuums have performed for me when I have used them.  I can remember actually just throwing one of them in the trash it was so useless, and repairing it (by installing a new battery) was (of course) going to be more expensive than getting a brand new one--which I wasn't going to do.  So, I swore off cordless vacuums entirely for many years, and personally only made the mistake of buying one once.  Until now, that is.  But I'm getting ahead of myself.So, my wife had expressed the desire to own a small cordless vacuum many times, so that she could just grab it to suck up dust bunnies and cat litter and what not between major vacuumings.  I refused to buy a dirt devil or black and decker, but then I read about the Dyson.  I knew the run-time vs. power trade off, and I knew that there was also obviously a price vs. performance trade-off, but I decided to give the DC34 a chance.  I bought mine at BB&B; for about what Amazon is selling it for (or a bit more).Well, very quickly I grew to dislike this thing.  First, I dislike bagless vacuums in general, but I set that aside for this small hand held.  Still, even being prepared for the downsides of bagless vacuums, this one goes beyond.  It INSTANTLY looks dirty and ugly.  Yeah, you see that nice, clear, fancy looking picture on the Amazon main page?  Forget it.  It will never look like that.  Not even if you try to clean it after every single use, because you can't get up very far inside the dirt container.  Or not easily.  And even if you do, it very quickly scratches anyway, so, well, it will always look dirty.  And, OK, that's not a huge deal, and it's certainly not a deal breaker.  Comes with the territory.  But be forewarned.More importantly, however, the design of this vacuum is seriously flawed.  The exhaust is small, concentrated, and in the wrong place and too close to the nozzle.  Perhaps if it were a bigger opening and were shooting upward things would be better.  As it is, however, it's so very very not good.  OK.  So picture this.  Ah, you see a dust bunny you want to vacuum up.  Excellent!  You just dropped some major coin on a fancy neat POWERFUL high tech handheld vacuum.  No problem.  You grab your DC34 and fire it up as you push the nozzle toward the soon-to-be-gone dust bunny.  But, much to your surprise, a whirlwind--a vortex--of crazy air grabs your prey and sends it erratically flying away!  It's INSANE!  Seriously.  You can not effectively vacuum up dust bunnies!  What is the freaking point of a handheld vacuum if it is frustrating to use for this basic task?  OK.  So, if you put the long crevice tool nozzle RIGHT NEXT To the dust bunny BEFORE pulling the trigger--and if you pulse the trigger--just a quick ON time then release--then you can reliably vacuum up that dust ball.  But otherwise?  Very hit or miss.Next, this thing is just kind of awkward.  It's tall.  It's heavy for it's size.  And it CAN'T BE TURNED ON ITS SIDE.  Or not very much.And despite various claims and raves about how powerful it is, it's really not that powerful.  I have found that in vacuuming up cat litter I need to use the crevice tool and need to get right on top of it before it gets pulled in.  This means lots of sweeping that stupid thing back and forth left and right.  And many missed little bits.  And for the record, I take very good care of my tools.  I have taken my DC34 apart and cleaned the cloth filter.It's just not good.  Period.  If it were $30 I'd probably give it three stars.  But at like five or six times that price?  What a joke.  And as for Dysons in general, talk to any vacuum repair person or shop and ask them what they think of Dysons.  At best they'll say that they're great for their repair side of the business.  My brother-in-law owns a cleaning business and he takes a VERY dim view of the bigger Dyson vacuums, which he found to be heavy, and not very good performers.Dyson spends an incredible amount of money on advertising.  That's the only reason they are such a well known name in vacuums.  You're much better of looking into Miele (for canisters), Sebo (for uprights), and Riccar.Don't.  Waste.  Your.  Money.\",\n",

I tried a plethora of settings; high heat, low heat, steam, no steam.  No heat, just that Frankenstien walk then squatting down.  When I turned the \"i-touch\" button off the iron heated quickly with boiling steam. I got a dime-sized burn on my stomach from a spurt of boiling water when I lifted the iron from horizontal to move it.I couldn\\'t get through on the Oliso customer service number.  When I sent them an e-mail explaining I was doing a review for Amazon.com and I needed a solution for the iron I got a call-back from Kevin.  After he guided me through all the settings again with no results, and suggesting Amazon had sent me a used iron, he gave me instructions for sending the iron in under warranty.I tracked the iron to Oliso in San Francisco (after it was miss-routed to Hayward, CA ) and it supposedly arrived there on Nov 6, 2013. I sent an e-mail asking if the iron had actually arrived..... No answer.Nov 14, 2013 I sent Kevin an e-mail asking the status of the case.....No answer.This iron has been on the market since at least 2009. If they don\\'t have the issues ironed out (sorry) by now they probably never will. Without the i-touch feature you just have a very heavy, expensive yellow iron.  If the landing gear deploys and won\\'t retract you just have a very expensive yellow door-stop.The iron has a year warranty; add three months if you register the iron. Big woop!  Judging from my experience consider this;  If the iron breaks down twice you lose about two months use of the iron.  At the present cost of $18.50 per trip, standard shipping, you have spent enough to buy another medium price iron from de longi, Panasonic , B&D;  or numerous other manufacturers.If you think you just have to have this iron my suggestion is keep another iron as back-up .If I get the iron back, or a working re-placement I will be back for an up-date of this review.UPDATE: Nov 30,2013. As promised I\\'m back to do an update. I received the first non-working-out-of-the box iron on Oct 27,2013. I got the replacement iron  on Nov 27.2013, one month and $18.50 shipping later. This iron seems to work very well for the moment. I like the long cord and the ball and socket swivel. The iron heats quickly and raises and lowers the way it\\'s supposed to. The settings are easy to read. After being burned by a spurt of boiling water from the first iron I\\'m a little leery of the steam but it seems to work alright. I guess the question is \"Are you feeling lucky?\". If you get a working iron, fine. If your iron doesn\\'t work and you have to deal with customer service you might be singing the blues.  Of course, there\\'s no guarantee how long the iron will last.',\n",

I had always used electric blankets in the winter but didn't really care for the extra bulk on top of me. About 1 years ago I stayed at my sister's and the guest bed had a heated mattress pad on it. I liked it so much I decided to get one when my electric blanket died. Well, one side of the blanket died this year and I had my excuse. :-)I also have a programmable thermostat on my furnace and it's set to lower the temperature in the house to 55 overnight. I'm comfortably warn in my bed with the mattress pad set quite low (#1 on one side & #2 on the other) and just a sheet and light comforter over me. The sheet and comforter is the same way I sleep in summer so the mattress pad is supplying enough warmth to keep me comfortable in a 55 room. I turn it on a while before I go to bed and the bed is warmed enough to be comfortable and then warms up a bit more once I'm in bed.The mattress pad is comfortable to sleep on (I can't feel the wires at all) and I like the automatic 10-hour cut-off.

       "  'description': \"Serta Damask Stripe Electric Heated Mattress Pad - Start saving on your energy bill when you lower your thermostat and stay comfy with the all over penetrating warmth of this low-voltage mattress pad. We've designed an electric mattress pad that not only warms your bed, but also rejuvenates it. The 233-thread count 80-percent poly/20-percent cotton dobby stripe decorative shell is incredibly soft and soothing but that's just one of the wonderful features of this pad. Constructed within the pad is the patented Safe and Warm low-voltage technology. This low-voltage mattress pad includes a small power supply box that changes 120-volt AC home current into non-hazardous low-voltage DC current (very similar to a battery) to provide warmth, protection and safety even if the pad becomes wet. Unlike other warming pads with their thick bulky wires, the wires in the Serta pads are so small and thin; they are virtually unnoticeable. During construction we place the thin wires 3-inch apart and evenly distribute them from head to toe. The benefit to you is a pad that gives more of an even heat and has no annoying hot or cold spots. The twin size pad comes standard with one easy to read, easy to turn, non-slip computerized controller to adjust the temperature of the pad. A giant backlit display with auto dimming feature provides more convenience for night time adjustments with out having to turn on the lights. For cozy sheets before bed time, it has an automatic pre-heat and hold feature. You simply turn it on and the pad will warm up on HI until it reaches the temperature that you pre set your dial on and then adjusts itself to hold it there. For your safety, convenience and power conservation it has an automatic shut off feature that will shut the pad off after 10-hour just in case you forget. It also comes standard with built in over-temperature protection for that extra bit of safety and peace of mind.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"With the Eureka Whirlwind upright, there's no need to rely on mere  eyesight to determine whether your floor is clean. This vacuum supplies  the features to ensure a thorough vacuum jobandthe feedback  technology to help you gauge them. For starters, Eureka's Dirt Alert  device uses a beam of light to scan the floor in front of the machine.  If debris breaks up the beam, an indicator light lets you know to keep  vacuuming. Once dirt is in the machine, it spins through the Whirlwind's  cyclonic dust collector into particulate chambers nestled in a  see-through cup. When the dust cup is full, you just unhook it and dump  it out. The HEPA filtration system, perhaps the Whirlwind's most desirable  feature, filters both suctioned air and exhaust to trap ultra-fine  particles. Pollen, dander, and spores--down to 0.3 microns in size-- stay inside the machine where they can't trigger allergies. A pre-motor  filter, that can be rinsed clean regularly, assists the HEPA filter,  which requires replacement about twice yearly. Lights on the feedback  panel let you know when to clean or change the filters.The Eureka Whirlwind is designed for carpet or bare floors, with a hardwood  setting and eight carpet options. On-board attachments include a  crevice tool, a combo brush for furniture and upholstery, two extension  wands, and a see-through, clog-resistant hose. Built with an  ergonomically curved grip, a no-tip design, and a quiet motor, the  vacuum is comfortable and convenient to use. The 15-inch cleaning path,  oversized brush roll, and wide-beam headlight, as well as the ability  to clean 11 feet above the floor are all nice features. A back-mounted  helper handle even makes the Whirlwind easy to take up and down the stairs.--Emily Bedard\",\n",

It also looked funny because I had to take the arms off the chair to get it to slide under my desk.  When I saw that this one had arms that flipped up and was not all leather AND was on a lightening deal I took a chance.The pros:  The chair looks expensive and the arms flip up so it can push in completely to a desk.The cons and I'll live with its:  I got the brown version and was slightly disappointed that only the mesh and leatherette portions were brown - all plastic parts are black or silver (frame the mesh attaches to is black.  Crossbars on the back are silver - this is my least favorite part since it stands out when you look at it from the back)).  But I will get used that that.It came with a scratch on the silver base but I happened to have a silver paint marker and a quick dab with that fixed it.It is nowhere near as comfortable as my previous chair.  The seat is rather firm and isn't comfortable to sit on for long periods of time.  Also it doesn't recline easily.  I loosened the tilt tension all the way and I can get it to recline a bit but only if I put my feet up on my desk and really push back.  Hoping that loosens up over time.Overall, it's an ok chair.  Since looking expensive and having flip up arms were my primary requirements I am keeping the chair - it knocked those two out of the park.  But I would have really liked to have the chair be more comfortable for the price I paid.\",\n",

No odor when it is new -- unlike plastic curtains.3. The creases from where it was folded are still there a month later - even though I have intentionally aimed the hot shower stream on them. Hope these come out when it is laundered.4. There are only two magnets - one in each of the bottom corners.

As long as side edges and magnets are positioned properly, the curtain does its job.5. There is a minimum of billowing. Hardly any. Don\\'t know why, but this curtain does not crowd into the shower space. Maybe the airy open weave of the see-through panel fabric changes the air-flow?6.

       " 'B0029LHHPY': {'Best review': 'A year ago, I invested in a high-quality memory foam mattress because I was waking up at night with hip pain on my old-but-firm inner spring mattress.  I had been wanting to try a memory foam pillow ever since I got the bed so, when I saw this pillow advertised as a memory foam pillow, I ordered it.My first error was that I apparently did not read the product description fully, because this is not at ALL what I expected.  Most memory foam pillows are quite slim, but this one is HUGE and doesn\\'t feel at all like a memory foam pillow.  I guess the difference is that this pillow has memory foam at its core but is, in fact, a regular pillow AROUND a foam core, so you don\\'t feel the foam at all (after much use, when the regular pillow stuffing gets flatter, you would probably feel it, but definitely not when it is new).The pillow is very nice looking and seems very well made, so even though it wasn\\'t what I had expected, I looked forward to trying it.  Well...the first night didn\\'t go so well.  I don\\'t think I made it 5 minutes before I had to throw it off the bed and revert to my old pillow.  I am a side sleeper with a very short neck and this pillow is 5-6\" high.  I just could not get comfortable enough to go to sleep using this pillow.  The next night, I fared better and got to sleep but think I ended up switching back to my old pillow during the night.  I kept trying it, and it kept ending up on the floor, so I moved it back to my combination guest room/office.  I take naps there some days, so I have continued to use it off and on; it seems to work better for a short nap than for a full night\\'s sleep--for me at least.Bottom Line:  If you like a high, firm pillow or have a long neck, this may work great for you.  If you prefer a slimmer pillow and/or are a side sleeper like me, this may not be the best pillow for you.  I suspect that, once I am able to use the pillow enough that the batting around the memory core compresses, it could be a very comfortable pillow.  As of now, though, it is still relegated to the guest bed.Note:  Some reviews commented that this pillow would not fit their regular pillowcases.  I happened to have a set of new pillowcases still in the package that I was going to use for a craft project and they fit this pillow (just barely), so I didn\\'t personally have a problem with that.  It\\'s possible that if I tried to use the pillow with one of my old pillowcases, this might not be the case.',\n",

The installation was tricky, but mostly because I wasn't sure what I was doing.If I can help just one person with the following....My advide would be to attach the brackets to the head/foot board FIRST, then line up your entire assembled bed frame so that you can see excatly where the screws/holes will line up. The way I did it incorrectly the first time was to attach the brackets to the just the left-side of the bed frame first, attached it to the left-side of the head board, and then did the right side. Next, I tried to assembele the bed frame, but it was too wide with the direction I had the brackets so I had to undo everything and start over.

       " 'B00009RAVL': {'Best review': \"My wife and I have been using this fan in our bedroom now for the past week.  I honestly don't understand the complaints from other reviewers about this fan being noisy.  We find this fan to be quieter than any other stand fan that we have ever owned (and we have owned many).  I do have a theory about what may be causing the noise they are complaining about (explained below).The fan arrived from Amazon in just a few days.  The box arrived without a scratch and upon inspection I found no damage to any of the contents.  The asssembly instructions are a little confusing but it is honestly easy to figure out without any instructions.  Six screws and washers attach the round, weighted base to the middle control section.  Some have complained about the screw holes not aligning properly.  Well I found that I had to have my wife hold the control module pole while I gently twisted the round base, at the same time that I installed the mounting screws.  This allowed the screws to be installed without problem.  Two small screws attach the fan motor housing to the extension pole coming from the top of the middle control section.  The fan blade goes on easily.  The only real challange I had was attaching the fan safety cage, which requires a gentle yet firm touch to snap the two halves together while making sure everything is lined up properly.  It was after I had everything installed and the fan plugged in that I noticed that there was a layer of protective plastic over the Soleus badge plate in the center of the front fan safety cage.  I pulled the plastic off and everything was ready to go (or so I thought).I turned the fan on and played around with all of the settings.  The fan worked extremly well and seemed very quiet, even at the highest speed setting.  However, when we turned the fan on low, to run overnight while we slept, I noticed a little noise.  It just sounded like the typical noise of the fan blades moving air.  As I listened the noise seemed to get louder and softer without any sort of pattern.  I shut the fan off and turned on the light.  I ended up pulling the front of the safety cage off and it was at that moment that I noticed some protective plastic on the inside of the front safety cage, on the backside of the Soleus badge plate.  If you remember, I mentioned that I had pulled some plastic off the front of this badge plate but obviously the plastic was wrapped around the entire plate.  I just didn't notice that when I was assembling the safety cage.  It was a little challanging but I was able to remove all of the plastic from the backside of that plate.After re-attaching the front section of the safety cage, I turned the fan on low and listened carefully.  The strange noise was gone and the fan has remained extremely quiet ever since.  Although most of the components of this fan are made of plastic, it has a fairly solid feel.  It looks very high tech and attractive.  We love the adjustment abilities of the motor/fan head.  Be advised, the platinum (silver) colored plastic on the base and control module scratch very easily.  I put a fairly large scratch across the top surface of the round base by accident and it looks quite ugly.  However, it is in our bedroom and nobody will see it anyway.  Overall my wife and I would highly recommend the Soleus Air FSH-40G remote controlled stand fan to anyone looking for a quiet, stylish looking stand fan that has wonderful features, including an easy to use remote control.  It is easy to assemble, moves a lot of air with very little noise, has just about any feature that you could ever want from a fan, and it seems to be built with quality components that should last for many years.  The cost of this fan is not cheap but I feel that approximately $50 for a fan of this quality and performance is well worth the money we paid.  =o)\",\n",
       "  'description': \"The Soleus Air FSH-40G 16-inch stand fan is about as deluxe as you can get, short of having a personal servant to fan you with ostrich feathers. Not only does it have the typical three speeds, it also has three oscillation wind styles: back and forth, up and down, and a figure 8 pattern. There's a timer that can be set for up to 7-1/2 hours; that way the fan can shut during the cooler hours of the night. Oh, and all that can be set and adjusted by remote control, without ever getting up from bed or from the comfy chair. Not bad, huh?The FSH-40G stand fan has a contemporary design, all silver-tone metal, with a contoured fan pole and clear plastic fan blades. There's a liquid crystal readout screen built into the pole for the various setting displays.

I'm not adamantly opposed to the use of chemicals, but the fact that this product works so well completely with steam is wonderful and certainly a plus for me. The steam's pressure and temperature seems great, and I could notice a stark difference after cleaning my apartment and upholstery furniture.My only big complaint is that the unit has a lot of down time overall between heating up and repressurizing and can't be refilled safely until cooled down. I hear the Ladybug line is better if you want to mitigate that problem and price is not an issue, but they're much more expensive for not profoundly better cleaning. Once this heats up, it'll give plenty of high-pressure steam to clean hundreds of square feet (minus very brief intervals occasionally while it repressurizes during use), so it's perfect for apartments and smaller homes and would really do fine for anyone as long as they can be patient. Just keep in mind that initial boiling and cooldown adds an hour or so of dead time to each tank's use, so if you're going to do a lot of steaming, be prepared to have other things to keep you occupied.Also, it includes a nice little compartment for various attachments to be stored, which is a nice little touch that I wish more cleaning tech had.\",\n",

It feels very cheap and one can only hope that it will last a few seasons.  The assembly is very straight-forward; easy to connect to a garden hose (works fine in \"dry\" mode as well).  It may have to do with this particular unit - one of the nozzles is temperamental - it mists in random times and decides to go to sleep more often than not. The grounded GFCI plug makes this a safe option (obviously, ensure you have an appropriate outlet and easy access to connecting a garden hose to prevent kids from tripping over). The cheap-looking construction and the inconsistent nozzle performance makes it difficult an enthusiastic recommendation. Comparable units from Frontgate and NewAir should be on a potential buyer\\'s list.  Some of the newer models come with remote control and 18\" blades (expect to pay about 50$ more).',\n",

We keep the heater in our large master bedroom, which is about 340 square feet. It does a great job heating up the bedroom before we go to bed. It takes about 35 minutes to raise the temperature in the bedroom about 10-degrees. This has allowed us to lower the thermostat on the whole house furnace at night which saves energy.THe Lasko has several features that work together to provide excellent performance. It uses a fan to circulate the heated air throughout the room and it this allows for even warmth all over a large room. The Lasko only becomes slightly warm to the touch on the outside surface which makes it a good choice for rooms with kids and pets. I have owned other electric heaters that get hot and can burn young fingers. Another great feature is the excellent digital thermostat which I have found to be very accurate. At a glance you can read the room temperature which is shown in a clear red LED display. You can set the temperature you want and the heater will automatically shut off when it reaches the desired temperature. It will come back on when the room temperature drops below your set point making it ideal for use all night. Once the room has reached our desired temperature of 68-degreees I will reset the thermostat for 64-degrees before retiring for the evening.  This allows us to save energy during the night but sleep well knowing the heater will turn on if it gets really cold in the bedroom.I would have rated the Lasko 5-stars but subtracted one star for noise. The unit does make some noise when operating so we have it placed 14-feet away from the bed. At this distance the noise is diminished but it may disturb you if you are a very light sleeper.',\n",

       " 'B007QZ8NII': {'Best review': 'Year 3 update: QUALITY CHANGE ALLERT!Although my soleus KY-80 is still working fine, I have a feeling that the quality of the unit has changed since 2012. There are MANY 2014 reviews that talk about a grinding noise, leaking, and the AC function stopping because the self evaporation feature is not working. This causes the small collection tray at to bottom of the unit to fill up and have to be manually drained. I have a feeling that there is an internal pump that is defective, so the water just accumulates in the drip pan...which only holds about 2 cups. I had this issue with my old Whytner. Although it is easily remedied by elevating the unit and placing a bucket underneath, this is NOT how a fully functional PAC should work under all but extreme humidity conditions. I think Soleus has been either been shipping defective units, or has re-designed their 8000 btu models to save themselves money. So keep this in mind while reading the original reviews below:=======================================================================================================Year 2 update:1)We\\'ve had to use the Soleus for the last few days because the central system in our bldg was not up and running. The effctiveness of PACs (including this one)seems to depend on the ambient and outdoor temps and the amount of humidity. If the outdoor air is humid (>70%), but the temp is not that hot (less than 80*), don\\'t expect the unit to lower the room temp more than a couple degrees beyond what it achieves the first half hour of operation. As another reviewer explained, single hose PACs have an in-efficiency issue(cooled room air is being taken in to the unit via the side of the machine instead of a second intake duct) BUT...the comfort level of having the humidity decreased (by 4-8%)can maker a bigger difference than having the temp lowered by a few additional degrees. Therefore, I\\'m still happy with the Soleus, which is actually more effective at taking moisture out of the air than the bldg\\'s central system. BTW...Unless something is wrong with my unit, the only difference between the AC and Dehumidiy modes is that the latter does not have a thermostat/temp control...the cold air output is the same.2)I have not been constantly draining the condensation into a bucket like I had to do with my first PAC and have had no leakage problems. I recently found the point that the machine cries \"uncle\" with automatic shut-off, though. Our building\\'s central air fizzed in the middle of a(very humid) night...we woke up to a reading of 96% (yech) on the humidistat. I turned on the the KY-80 and it had the humidity down to 84% in 2 hours before shutting off. I shut off the machine, drained the water into a bucket, turned the AC back on. It got the humidity down to 68% over the next 3 hours and has been fine since...no shut-off.3)I have taken another reviewer\\'s suggestion and duct-taped AC filter replacement material (available on Amazon or any hardware store)over the lower intake vents to help keep the coils cleaner (there are 2 removeable/cleanable filters on the upper vents).Below is the original review from last year:====================================================================================================================This is my 2nd Portable AC...I wrote an extensive review about the first one I bought in 2006 that goes into details about the problems with all PAC\\'s...so understand that my first experience set the bar pretty low. Also,the reason we own a PAC is to supplement the building\\'s central air system that has a way of breaking down on hot, humid weekends, so it is not used as our primary cooling device but just in emergency situations to cool our 180 sq ft bedroom. During the hot spell last week when the central system went kaput, the old Whytner was making funny noises and overheating so we threw it out...here is a link to that review if you want to read it:http://www.amazon.com/10000-Portable-Conditioner-ARC-10D-Whynter/product-reviews/B000KLSRP4/ref=dp_top_cm_cr_acr_txt?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints;=1So far, the Soleus KY-80 that we bought as a replacement is a big improvement even though it has 2000 fewer BTUs:1)The foot print of this model is wonderful: a small unit for a small room. I would rather have a dual hose model...they are much more efficient, but we just don\\'t have the space. Also, it has good design elements that make it easier to put it together and take it apart quickly for easy storage if you are not using it on a regular basis. Even something as simple as a cord winder is a big help. The two way leuvers are good...keep the verticle ones facing up! My only minor concern is that there is no removable filter on the lower half of the unit.2)The set up was quick and easy BUT I am using a home-made window kit that was put together by cutting a hole for the hose in a piece of hi-density foam rubber (from an old leg pillow) that slides in and out of the window easily and insulates better without duct tape. The biggest complaints about this and other larger, more expensive units are the cheesy window kits...easily resolved by putting together your own. Also...before powering on the unit, make sure it is in an upright position for a few hours! I ran across this suggestion from other PAC reviewers. This gives the refrigerant a chance to settle if the unit was shipped upside down or sideways.3)The day it arrived, the ambient temp was only 75d and relatively low humidity...no real need for AC, but I did want to make sure the unit worked. It sure did. In 30 minutes, it lowered the temp from 75 to 72d and the humidity from 46% to 43%. In contrast, I put on the central unit(its working again) in the other bedroom as a basis for comparison and it got the temp down to 73d in the same time frame, so the Soleus did better than the central system. As with my old unit, I slipped a fiberglass insulating sleeve over the duct hose...this is a big help for all PACs because they can generate enough heat to nulify the cooling.4)The other major complaint about PAs is the \\'self evaporative\\' feature that tends not to work...see my old review for details. I can\\'t comment on this because the humidity level today is not challenging, but I am fully prepared to elevate the unit onto a platform (I use an old desk top computer on its side) and drain it into a bucket if necessary...that\\'s just the nature of the beast. Also, the higher the unit is elevated, the more effective the cooling will be since cool air falls/hot air rises. Again, the fact that the unit weighs only 50 lbs helps!5)The noise level of the Soleus KY-80 is darned acceptable...much quieter than the old Whytner, and certainly no noiser than the larger window units that some of my friends have in their apts. You have to realize that there is a motor and a compressor that are IN the room...not hanging out the window (like window units)or outdoors or in a basement (like central systems).6)The price is certainly right...but my concern is longevity. The old PAC lasted 6 years but it was only used perhaps 10 nights a year. If this one does as well, for the price, I\\'ll be satisfied.The 5 stars (so far) are based on an apples to apples comparison: There is no way that the BTUs of a single hose portable are going to equal those of a window unit, or the ambient cooling is going to be equal to that of a central system. But having said that, so far, this little unit works quite well.Update: This past weekend our bldg\\'s central air went out...it was VERY humid even tho the temp inside was only 79d, the humidity was 62%. I set the unit up in the living room to see what would happen even though the area is at least 700 sq ft. The unit reduced the temp by 2 degrees...which is amazing considering the size of the room, but it reduced the humidity by 9%...down to 53%. The room was quite comfortable. Fortunately, that evening the central was working again, and I had the Soleus disconnected, drained, and back in the closet in fewer than 15 minutes.',\n",

It is not easy to find an affordable duvet cover that is 100% cotton and looks THAT nice. And to top it off, the price was pretty decent. It wasn't the highest quality fabric, but I didn't really sleep on it. It just made my bed look pretty like a pair of really high heels. Unfortunately, laundry day comes and I wash it according to the instructions on the tag: with cold water, on the gentle cycle, no bleach, blah, blah, blah. At the end of the cycle when I take of the duvet cover I see that the white part (background) seems to have a grayish color cast. I washed again with detergent and some baking soda and white distilled vinegar and it looked slightly better but still gray. I also bought the matching shower curtain for my bathroom and the exact same thing happened to it when I washed it. I did the rest of my laundry with no issues that day, so there is something seriously wrong with the fabric they use to make those curtains and blankets. I am extremely disappointed because I loved my duvet cover and curtain so much and now they are trash. I expected at least decent quality from Perry Ellis.

I purchased this for about $150 with Prime, shipping to Hawaii arrived in about a week (standard for Prime in Hawaii). Box was very small for the mattress size, and easy for me to carry. Opened up the box on the sofa sleeper frame and cut open the plastic. The mattress began to unfold and expand within minutes, however it did take about 8 hours for it to fully open to just under 4&#34; tall. With the old mattress i could feel every bar under it and was horribly uncomfortable to just lay there for a couple of minutes. The first night I thought I would try out the new mattress. I laid on it to watch tv and honestly could not feel the bars under the mattress at all.I recently had my first guests over for a week and they both said that the bed was very comfortable, and didn't feel like it was a sofa sleeper at all.We did notice that you will want to pull the sofa sleeper out about an hour before bed if possible to allow for it to come back to full thickness.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'Box springs are a perfect hiding place for bed bug because of their convenience to your mattress. Bed bugs thrive in mattresses and bedding because of the accessibility to your blood, body heat, and carbon dioxide you exhale. Bed bugs feed by sucking blood-preferably human blood. They pierce your skin with two hollow tubes; one injects saliva and the other sucks your blood. Within minutes, they can engorge themselves with blood and reach three times their size.The resulting bite will manifest itself as an open sore, pussy blister, rash or hives and the subsequent itching is incessant. The broken skin and exposed sores can lead to varied levels of infection. Combined with other airborne allergens, bed bugs can trigger an asthma attack. Allergic reactions to the saliva injection can, in extreme cases, result in a multi-system allergic reaction and lead to death. Other psychological effects such as anxiety, stress, and insomnia are also common to bed bug victims.The Encase box spring protector will completely eliminate the passage of bed bugs to and from your box spring serving as a mechanism for both treatment and prevention.Cal King includes: 1 cal king mattress protector (72\" x 84\"), King includes: 1 king mattress protector (78\" x 80\"), Queen includes: 1 queen mattress protector (60\" x 80\"), Full XL includes: 1 full XL mattress protector (54\" x 80\"), Full includes: 1 full mattress protector (54\" x 75\", Twin XL includes: 1 twin XL mattress protector (39\" x 80\"), Twin includes: 1 twin mattress protector (39\" x 75\").',\n",

Originally purchased to humidify the upper level of our house, we now tend to use it more to humidify individual rooms.  It has worked well in both applications.The fan noise is loud on the higher settings, but we keep it set at fan speed 2 while sleeping.  We love having the ability to set the desired humidity level with this humidifier.  After the target humidity level is reached, the unit shuts off and turns back on later when the humidity level drops.Refilling the tanks can be a challenge.  We use either the kitchen sink or the laundry room sink because our bathroom faucets are too low to fill the tanks effectively.  You need enough clearance to get the tank under the faucet while allowing the tank to stay level.  It also helps to have a counter or other level surface to rest the tank on while refilling.  It took me a few tries to master properly inserting the water tanks back in the humidifier.  If you do not insert the tanks correctly, the water will not flow from the tank.  I also experienced some minor spilling of water when first trying to insert the tanks.',\n",

The installation guide uses terms like &#34;use 6 'JJ' screws&#34;, the only way to know which of the three screw lengths is 'JJ' is to first count all the screws out in to piles, and then refer to the packing list to find the description given to each screw.

On the the quality of construction, in the previous shelves, you can see patterns cut into the wood similar to, but not exactly like the dovetailed joints of well-constructed wood pieces, these joints previously made for a more interesting finish and an over-all sturdier product. in the shelves I just recieved, all of the former jointing is GONE and the previously \"stackable\" shelf has become noticeably & frighteningly flimsy. even the wood itself is now far softer and more susceptible to early damage caused by general assembly & predicably by general use. while the last shelves were more difficult to assemble due to the hardness of the wood, the wood is now butter-soft. assembly was easy but I feel ripped-off and cheated on the quality. the shelves I purchased were $59.00 each... but heirloom quality, the shelves that arrived at my door aren\\'t worth a very generous $40.00, with the additional knowledge that they might not last more then 1 or 2 years.during the past year or 2, the production of these winsome wood shelves went from proud pieces to its more current form of functional trash. now, I\\'m very upset because I have a small apartment & I really NEED shelves but these pieces of s*** aren\\'t worth the price I paid. I\\'m not paying for this!I would not recommend these shelves to anyone.',\n",

There is potential for hidden mold, this seemed like a good idea.The past half a year I have depended on Afrin nasal spray almost daily, just to breathe some of the time. I spent as much money on the Afrin as I did the AirFree Onix. Add to that constant use of a neti pot, Tylenol sinus and other items.....and I rarely was able to breathe out of my nose. A sinus infection, anti biotics, dental infection and the issues went on and on.Since I have this, I have used the Afrin twice. No neti pot, nothing else. I am breathing better than I have since I don't know when.We have since bought a second unit for the upstairs bedroom.My health has just been too complicated lately to state positively, this alone was the answer for me. But when your health is this seriously compromised, this is a relatively inexpensive product to try.I do however find the night light very annoying. I can not stand any light at all.

It will help protect clothes and valuables from the damaging effects of mold/mildew and moisture rot. It is 100% renewable and needs no power to operate. Just hang the Gurin unit in a closet, or you can place it in other small, enclosed spaces, and it will start to adsorb moisture. There are no batteries required or cords to plug in, the unit works without power. There is an indicator window with special \"moisture meter crystals\" that change from blue (when dry) to pink (when wet) to indicate when the unit needs to be \"renewed\". The unit will adsorb approximately 8-10 ounces of moisture (depending on humidity levels this should take between 6 - 8 weeks). Once the moisture has been adsorbed it cannot leak or spill. This unit uses a specialized, engineered, crystallized silica gel that is odorless, non-toxic and completely safe. When the indicator crystals turn pink it is time to \"re-new\" the unit. Simply remove the unit from where it is adsorbing moisture and plug it into a power outlet or power strip in a well ventilated area (bathroom with extraction fan, garage, outside, etc.). There is a built-in heater that will warm the crystals allowing them to expand and release the moisture as water vapor into the outside air. It takes about 12-14 hours to completely re-new the unit. When it is completely renewed the indicator crystals will change back to blue. The unit is brand new again and ready to adsorb another 8-10 ounces of moisture. The crystals will remain active for 10 years and we offer a 5 year limited manufactures warranty on all of our DHMD-110 units.',\n",

This package came to me with a large hole/tear in the box and no packing materials. The front of the vacuum looked worn. I would not go as far to say that it had \"other people\\'s dirt\" in it like another reviewer, but it was obviously used, though it appeared to have a new cord, roller and accessories. The vacuum was seemingly unbroken after its journey in the holey box, so I assembled the handle and read the instructions before firing it up.We bought this to replace an older (circa 1996) Hoover Windtunnel with bags which had begun emitting burning odors and got very hot during operation. The suction was still good, but it was really time to retire it. The Y bags on the old Windtunnel always seemed rather small, had to be replaced frequently and seemed to be going up in price. I had been wanting a bagless vacuum for several years. Being satisfied with my previous Hoover and with a price under $50 we decided to go ahead and order this despite the mixed reviews here.It is very similar in appearance to my old Hoover. As others have mentioned, this reconditioned model is missing the \"dirt sensor\" feature. Annoying, but I was expecting that already. This has a few additional features like a powered hand tool for cleaning stairs, etc. I was not particularly impressed by this attachment, and the attachment hose itself is not very long or substantial. The vacuum power of the hose is somewhat inadequate. With my previous Windtunnel, when I would use the extension hose it would have full power while in use and suction would stop at the floor level. This is not designed that way and has a much weaker suction. The vac itself is rather heavy and kind of loud, but again, I was not surprised by this, since this is the nature of this product.Pro: The dirt chamber is easy to remove and put in, unlike other models I had looked at. It works very well and sucked up an unbelievable amount of dog/cat hair and dust. However, the small chamber filled up very quickly. The HEPA filter was positively choked with dust. This filter is located in the adjacent narrow chamber. The instructions indicate to tap the chamber against a garbage can to loosen all the dust. Probably more than half of it stuck onto the filter and in the recessed areas around it. I can see that this filter is probably going to have to be cleaned/replaced fairly quickly. The necessity to stop and dump the canister frequently caused dust to go everywhere. My hands were filthy. I felt like I had to take a shower after using it, not to mention my sinuses started to clog. I am beginning to wish I had gotten a non-bagless model...So, I have mixed feelings. On one hand, this is an unbelievable price for a Hoover Windtunnel. It appears to be in fine working order. However, the dust chamber to me seems quite small compared to other models I looked at, and I don\\'t care for the filter location and crevices around the filter which collect dust. (I\\'m not speaking of the pleats on the filter itself, but the locking mechanism that holds it in). This may be a caveat that these type of bagless vacs have, since this is my first experience with owning one. I have heard that these filters can get clogged, but it seemed kind of extreme to me.So, I am really not sure whether I would recommend it. At $50, it may be worthwhile as a second vac or to see if you like a bagless. I\\'m not sure that I do after this experience.',\n",

The HEPA filter chamber makes the U5700 a great choice  for allergy and asthma sufferers,  capturing even the finest dust and allergy-causing micro-particles that other vacuums miss or re-circulate.This vacuum comes with a full suite of on-board tools for above-surface cleaning or vacuuming hard-to-reach areas, including an attached hose, two extension wands, a dusting brush, furniture nozzle and crevice tool. Powerful suction and automatic tool conversion make these add-ons as useful as the vacuum itself. Hoover&#x92;s unique edge groomers remove dirt next to baseboards and furniture that most vacuums miss, and a headlight illuminates dark crevices and underneath furniture. A carpet-height setting adjusts to different cleaning conditions, and the vacuum cleans in a 15-inch path. This vacuum cleaner has been factory reconditioned, meaning it was returned to the manufacturer, who restores the appliance to like-new condition without the brand-new price. Some models may have cosmetic blemishes. Purchase includes a six-month warranty.--Mary Park',\n",

It\\'s been about four months of usage and the remote works flawlessly.With the fan on the lower two settings, the fan is relatively noiseless (for a fan anyway) and it still moves air well.What\\'s going wrong -As many other reviewers have mentioned, at the 3rd and 4th setting (the higher settings) the fan is pretty loud - even for a Vornado. Unfortunately, for the noise is makes, it doesn\\'t push as much air as it sounds like it should. Compared to a normal Vornado whole room circulator, I\\'d say it does maybe half the actual air volume (at least it feels that way).The other problem with the fan is that you can only feel the air from a very specific point. Move slightly to the right or left of the silver line and you won\\'t feel a thing. It\\'s very much like it\\'s moving a blade of air. So if you like indirect air movement, this is not the fan for you.Conclusion -Stick with the normal Vornado fans, this tower fan just isn\\'t a great addition to the Vornado line up.',\n",

The Vornado 154 Tower Circulator features uniquely contoured air outlets that create a wide span of constant airflow, without the need for oscillation.

       " 'B001DEXA86': {'Best review': 'I have had this since 2004, and it was purchased based on Bissell\\'s claim that it out cleans its competition...The ProHeat had features that were very attractive like an on-board heater, 12-amp heavy duty motor, 3 settings for the carpet cleaner dispenser, long handeld cleaner hose, and powerful suction. These were features that the more expensive competitors had, or didn\\'t have. We chose the ProHeat based on the price (it was nearly $100 cheaper than the Hoover) and the features.My first impressions on the cleaning power were mixed. It cleaned pretty good, about as good as the competiton and maybe a little better, but that was the only area that the ProHeat stood-out. It was relatively quiet when running as well. To use it, you need to fill the water tank, which is pretty easy. To get it out of the machine, you need to lower the machine\\'s handle all the way, raise the tank\\'s convenient carry handle and lift it out. It has a locking mechanism that keeps the cover on. To fill it, you push the tank\\'s handle all the way forward to lift the lid off, and pour in hot water (ideally, the hotter the better, but below boiling or semi-boiling because it will melt the bladder). Put the lid back on (it only goes on one way which I liked, no fiddling required), raise the carry handle, and set it back in the machine. Push the handle down back where it goes, and raise the machine\\'s handle and that\\'s it! Simple.The cleaning solution tank is also easy to fill. Just pull it out of the receptacle on the machine, making sure the dispensing end is tipped upright, then unscrew the base, pour in the solution, keeping it upright, and then set it back in the receptacle.To start it, you need to turn on the main power switch, then the heater switch. The heater won\\'t turn on independently. You have to have the main switch on first which is a mystery to me. Bissell says to let it run for a few minutes before using so the heater gets warmed up. You have a valve on the left side that switches between the floor cleaning mode and the handheld tool, which I also liked. There\\'s also a three-position switch for dispensing cleaning solution. The normal setting is for routine cleaning, the heavy setting dispenses the most solution to clean high-traffic or very dirty areas, and there\\'s also a water/pre-treatment setting that dispenses water for rinsing or a pre-treating chemical like Scotch Guard or spot remover.Cleaning is pretty simple, just push the trigger and let the machine do its thing. I wasn\\'t surprised or stunned at the cleaning power at all. It did what I asked it to and not much more. It did perform admirably and cleaned up all that I asked it to, including some set-in stains from juice, soda, and food like soup or stew. It even cleaned up pet \"stains\" and formula used for enteral tube-feeding, which is difficult to clean, and hardens into a glue-like gunk when dried. After pre-treating it, the Bissell took care of it. It did take a while, but eventually got it out. I did use it to clean a big hot chocolate spill that sat overnight in pre-treatment, and it did good, but didn\\'t really get all of it. I cleaned it for about 15 minutes too using the heavy solution setting.The handheld tool didn\\'t work very good. It does dispense water and cleaner, but never really sealed to the handle properly and air leaked out so it lost a good deal of suction. All it was really good for was scrubbing and pre-treating a tough stain. I used it to clean the back of my station wagon and was sort of disappointed because it didn\\'t get out all the dirt. They weren\\'t bad stains either and I soaked them in cleaner beforehand. I also used it to clean up the aforementioned hot chocolate spill without much effect. The hose was nice and long though!I am suspect of the \"heat\" part of ProHeat. I wasn\\'t impressed with how hot it got the cleaning water. I barely noticed any steam at all from it even on a cool day. Even when I filled the tank with hot water, it still wasn\\'t hot. Maybe mine was defective? Still, it should work as advertised.There are other problem areas as well. The plastic parts used to hold the hand tool in place are flimsy and broke after three months. Now the wand doesn\\'t stay in place and there\\'s really nowhere to stow it. Furthermore, this thing is heavy! It weighs about 30 pounds and besides being heavy it is very cumbersome and a bear to carry up stairs. I am a strong guy and I found myself man-handling it on occasion. The wheels are nice and big though, so it goes over thresholds good.The other area is leaking. The machine leaks if you set it sit in one place while running. The water tank also leaks out of the bottom when you take it off. Emptying the waste tank isn\\'t too bad. The water storage tank is actually two tanks in one. The inner bladder is for the clean water, which empties quickly, and there\\'s a separate storage for the wastewater, which isn\\'t very big and fills quickly. It empties out of the back of the tank, but I wished it held more like the machines you rent. The total storage is about 1-1/2 gallons, maybe less. It also has a removable little plastic mesh filter that picks up everything but the smallest dirt particles, and it gets dirty fast, but cleaning it is easy. Cleaning the rest of the machine is also pretty easy.The cleaning solution tank is also too small. It only lasted for 10 or so minutes of constant cleaning on the highest solution dispension setting. It also leaked when I took it out to fill it.Pros:Cleans carpets goodMotor is relatively quietThree settings for cleaning solution dispensingSelectable floor/tool functionLong cleaning wand hoseBig wheels make it easy to pushBuilt-in filter is easy to cleanCons:LeaksWater and cleaning solution tanks too smallHeater didn\\'t work very goodHand tool was almost uselessFlimsy plastic tool holder broke easilySo that\\'s the Bissell ProHeat. It\\'s a no-frills carpet cleaner that will do what you ask it to, but not much more. There are some bright spots, but the bad areas are enough to turn me off to it. There are better machines out there that cost more, but will be worth it.',\n",

Not fit for purpose \"as is\". To use this, some modification is required to rectify - you have to duct tape around the filter to seal it into position on the hoover to prevent the dust leak. Use a heavy duct tape. I decided to try it out yesterday, and it appears to work through the 2.5 hours of vacuuming at two different locations.Note also, this item is not (exactly) as shown on Amazon. Instead of two equal columns of hepa fan filter, the version I received has an additional \"third\" 1cm column along the middle of the panel apart from that the design looks similar Material used & finish differs. Filter material seem less robust than original though the third column may well reinforce it structurally to compensate.Came as loose unpackaged items. In fact all items purchased on this order were loose & unpackaged.  If you live in the US and get free postage, then take your chance - perhaps it is a case of getting what you pay for. Even then it has to be fit for purpose.',\n",

The large piece wasn't in the box which means that it was packaged and delivered this way. We called that night and requested a second one to be shipped and when this one arrived the top was split again! My husband was able to see that it wouldn't have mattered too much as it was on the bottom and not viewable. Once put together (which took over an hour as the directions are so confusing and there are so many screws, etc.) the top wouldn't fit on the base as the pieces were cut incorrectly. The entire piece was so off balance that you wouldn't have wanted to put a bowl of fruit on it let alone wine and beverages. I took pictures of the shoddy craftsmanship but unfortunately there isn't a way to add user photos on here. Now I have to return TWO huge boxes weighing as close to 100lbs each. The box from the first item was destroyed yet Amazon won't send me another box. Hopefully I have enough pieces of cardboard to duct tape the box back together to send it back.

The workmanship appears good: the hinges are assisted by helping brackets...and I did not find the mild scent [inside or out] objectionable.

The top provides a firm, pliable support for sitting.Only two caveats:a) opening the top requires the ottoman to be pulled away from whatever it is against by a few inches...just in case that might be important to some customers.b) Amazon shipped this via \"FedX Home Delivery\"...which was very fast [overnight, even on a weekend] but they left my order out in the rain without any cover, allowing it to be soaked by a heavy rain.

Vincent van Gogh was a Dutch post-Impressionist painter whose work, notable for its rough beauty, emotional honesty and bold color, had a far-reaching influence on 20th-century art. He sold only one painting during his lifetime, and was little known to the art world at the time of his death, but his fame grew rapidly thereafter. His influence on Expressionism, Fauvism and early abstraction was enormous, and it can be seen in many of his works. Giclee (jee-clay) is an advanced printmaking process for creating high quality fine art reproductions. The attainable excellence that Giclee printmaking affords makes the reproduction virtually indistinguishable from the original piece. The result is wide acceptance of Giclee by galleries, museums, and private collectors. Gallery wrap is a method of stretching an artist's canvas so that the canvas wraps around the sides and is secured a hidden, wooden frame.

The Amazon price on the 70 pint Frigidaire finally dropped back (eighty dollar drop!) to the normal price and I bought it (not from a 3rd party).  The Frigidaire is working perfectly and I have to empty it 3 times a day.]Well, it's that awful time of the year again.  Very humid and the outdoor temperature is between 60 and 70 degrees.  Too cool to turn on the air conditioner and too warm to turn on the heat(the house will become a virtual sauna).The house gets an odor from what I can only assume is mildew, which appears during only this damp weather.  When we step into the house after being gone for a few house, we can smell it (and we don't have any pets, carpets or kids -- and the sofas are leather).  No matter how clean I keep the house, the house smells during this odd cool but damp season.  The wood floors are cupped from the moisture.Yesterday we went to a big box store to pick up some small items.  I thought, maybe we should break down and buy a dehumidifier while we're here.  We had a choice of one brand, one size - the new reality:  The Hisense DH-70K1SJE.  We bought it.[EDIT:The review below was for the first unit I bought. The unit had so many problems, I'm not going to list them all.  I brought the dehumidifier back the next day and exchanged it for a new unit.  The new unit (after 24 hours) is working perfectly.  The relative humidity digital readout now consistently matches my hygrometer (the 1st unit starting reporting RH levels of random numbers).The RH of my 2000 sqft house is now down to 47% (30% to 50% RH for the interior of a house is considered ideal).END EDIT]I was able to set it up and had it running without having to read the manual.  When I turned it on, the noise was not unpleasant (my previous dehumidifier from many years ago, a Magic Chef,  made an horrible racket -- I truly hated having to turn it on).  The sound of this one is even, with no strange high pitched noises emanating from the motor.It's running right now about 15 feet from me and I'm quite content with the sound level.  It's actually a great white noise generator. I should mention that I have very good hearing and I'm very sensitive to noises.When I first turned the dehumidifier on, the relative humidity registered 63 percent which matched my hygrometer.  As I'm running the dehumidifier, I hear dripping sounds like a small waterfall.  After running the dehumidifier for just a few hours, the humidity dropped from 63 percent to 55.I should point out that my house is an open environment -- very few doors and two stories so I'm dehumidifying the whole house.  After a few more hours, the bucket was already full.Note: Removing the bucket is a nuisance.  The designers were just too clever for themselves.  There's no grip or handle to remove the bucket -- you have to pry it out with your fingernails.  And mind you, when the bucket is full, the bucket is heavy and not terribly easy to remove.I succeeded in removing the bucket and for the first time, I checked out the bucket handle.  It's lightweight plastic like a toy and looks and feels like the handle would snap right off when the bucket is heavy with water.  I carry the bucket from the bottom with two hands and drain it into the sink.  I use the handle only to carry the empty bucket back to reinstall.After running the dehumidifier for another few hours, the humidity is down to 43 percent but the temperature of the first floor rose from 72 to 77 degrees. It's getting a bit toasty but not disagreeable.Using a small flashlight that I keep nearby, I can see the water level in the bucket window (tinted dark blue for aesthetic reasons but another minor nuisance for the user).Pros:*  Noise is not unpleasant but wouldn't be suitable while watching TV, radio or having a normal conversation*  Water removal rate is very fast*  Humidity level is displayed in a digital readout and can be set in 5 degree increments*  The device can be pushed up against a wall since the air intake is located on the front, and the dry air is exhausted on the right side*  Device is fairly attractive*  The device has rollers (non-locking) and is easy to move around*  There's a window on the front of the bucket so that you can see the water level but the dark blue plastic makes it difficult to see without using a flashlight (or the room is very bright)*  The dehumidifier weight isn't too heavy. Meaning that even though I'm quite small, I can still pick it up.  My old dehumidifier was a bear to pick up, and I was a lot younger and stronger at that time.  The unit's light weight is due to the thin lightweight plastic.*  You don't need to read the manual to initially get the dehumidifier up and running. I turned it on and set the humidity level down to 40 percentCons:* The top handle is suitable only for gliding the dehumidifier around on a floor but way too flimsy to pick it up* The bucket handle is too lightweight for carrying a full bucket -- I suspect that the handle would snap off almost immediately, creating a mini-flood* There's a window on the front of the bucket so that you can see the water level but the dark blue plastic makes it difficult to see without using a flashlight (or the room is very bright)* Removing the bucket is a bit of a nuisance. It becomes increasing more annoying each time I need to empty the bucket.  It's starting to grate on my nerves.  The bucket needs a front handle or at least indentations on the sides of the bucket for one's  fingers.  What were they thinking when they designed it?  Were the designers kids fresh out of product design school?  One star off for this design flaw.Hmmm, as I'm writing this, the unit briefly turned itself off then back on again four times but there's been no electrical fluctuations, the bucket is only half full and the relative humidity is far from the target level.Fortunately, I kept the box, the receipt and the box store is only 10 minutes away if I need to exchange the unit before the last one is sold out. There were only four in stock.Aww, rats!  The unit turned itself off/on again and now the panel is frozen.The unit again turned itself off/on and this time the panel is working.  Will I ever be able to finish this review?I'm exchanging it today.\",\n",

I got her some supplies to help, and this was the last on the list I wanted to give her. It was the highest rated tray on Amazon, so order away did I.I don\\'t know much about the cost of bamboo, but when I received the box I thought it to be rather small. When my wife opened it, I thought, \"That\\'s it?\" There wasn\\'t really much to assemble, and I didn\\'t think there would be, but I was expecting a little more for $50.When I plugged in the metallic stands, I was surprised to find that they don\\'t really snap in or anything, so they\\'re bound to come loose if you\\'re holding from them. Not that you would be, but you can\\'t hang it up. It\\'s nice, however, that the stands have rubber grips on the arms to prevent sliding around on the edges of the tub.The book stand is of the same material and make as the stands, so I\\'m not sure if it\\'ll hold up to heavier books. Also, the notches to hold the books at various angles are cut through the wood, meaning water can easily splash from underneath and onto the pages. I realize some might expect things on the tray to get wet once in a while, but the tray could be designed better to prevent as much soaking as possible.The slots to put in the wine glass and for the bar of soap are nice, and the height of the wine slot is thick enough to put any size wine glass stand. My wife doesn\\'t drink much, but she decided to pour herself a glass of wine to test it out. It worked great, though she didn\\'t finish the wine...The spot to put the soap is nice and is porous, though I can\\'t remember off the top of my head if the pores go through the wood like the book stand slots. There are also little ridges on the back of the tray to hold things like a sponge or razor, though, if you have the water pretty high, they\\'ll probably dip off into the water.It\\'s a decent tray that seems sturdy enough, but for the price I can\\'t recommend it highly. It\\'s the highest rated one out there for its quality, I presume, but the wood seems to be the only thing people like about it.

My first impression (and some say that it is good) is that it is large. Very large. I have a stainless steel double sink with that little shelf area. It sticks out off the edge of that.But that means that it will hold a lot of soap, which it does. So I don&#8217;t have to fill it very often.It pumps easily and you can pump a little or a lot. It does leak a little around the top but I rinse it off while I&#8217;m running the dish water. It is nicely finished and looks good, albeit (as I mentioned earlier) large.

       "  'description': 'World Marketing\\'s NTK15A electric ceramic heater is great for heating small spaces (up to 200 square feet) inexpensively, or for providing local heat that allows you to turn down your building\\'s thermostat. This heater is especially efficient, heating 99 percent of the air intake to give you 5,200 Btu or instant heat at just 1,500 watts. In addition, the automatic thermostat cuts off the heat at the desired temperature. It\\'s safe, too: it includes a tip-over switch that cuts power when the unit is upended. The PTC heating element works at 200 degrees F, so it\\'s not hot enough to ignite paper, carpet, or other flammable materials.--Josh DettweilerWhat\\'s in the BoxHeater, power cord, instruction manualFive Tips for Buying a HeaterChoosing a space heater is a matter of sifting through a bewildering array of types, power ratings, and fuel sources. Let\\'s break it down a little to make the process easier.What are the different types of space heaters?Radiant heatersemit infrared radiation that directly warms the objects in front of the heaters (rather than the surrounding air). If you only need heat by a desk or in a small section of a room, a radiant heater is quiet and will use very little power.Forced-air heatersuse a fan to blow air that has been warmed by metal or ceramic heating elements. A forced-air heater is appropriate for quickly heating up a small- to medium-sized room, but can be noisy.Convection heatersdraw cold air from the floor; the air is warmed by heating coils and emitted from the top of the heater. A convection heater is appropriate for quickly heating up a small- to medium-sized room, but also can be noisy.Radiatorswork by heating oil enclosed in a reservoir, gradually heating the surrounding air. If heating speed isn\\'t an issue, you might want to opt for a radiator. These are extremely quiet and effective--perfect for bedrooms.Should I buy an electric or a combustion model?If you want a heater that will be available in emergencies, or that can heat areas larger than a single room, choose a \"combustion\" model--one that is powered by a gas or fuel like propane, kerosene, natural gas, or diesel. Which fuel type you choose depends largely on convenience and local availability. For example, diesel would be appropriate for a heater you take with you on long car trips.How powerful a heater do I need?Heaters are rated by BTU, which stands for British Thermal Unit (the amount of heat needed to heat one pound of water by 1 degree F). To find out how many BTU you need:Calculate the volume of the space to be heated by multiplying square footage by height.Multiply that number by 4 if your insulation is poor, 3 if it\\'s average, or 2 if it\\'s good.The resulting number is a ballpark figure for how many BTU you\\'ll need.Do space heaters cost a lot to operate?As a general rule, electric space heaters are more expensive to use than combustion models. To ensure energy efficiency, a thermostat is a must-have feature for any heater. For radiant heaters, models with a 360 degree heating surface can heat larger spaces. If you need a forced-air heater, models with ceramic elements tend to be more efficient.Are space heaters a fire hazard?Space heaters are implicated in about 25,000 residential fires every year. To ensure proper safety, always follow the manufacturer\\'s usage instructions and fill out the warranty card to receive informational updates from the manufacturer. Also, look for extra safety features such as an automatic shutoff switch that can shut down the unit if, for example, it gets upended. In addition, choose a model where the heating element is adequately enclosed within the unit.',\n",

Which is exactly what we needed for an older model, small one-story, 2 bedroom home. It had a much older model air conditioner in the wall which was very large. When that finally had to be retired, we installed a smaller window air conditioner in the wall of the house and that was an extremely large job (which took many hours and much material to make the hole in the wall small enough to accommodate the new air conditioner). That worked OK for a couple of years, but, when that air conditioner also failed, we were so pleased to find this unit which was made for wall installation. Again, it took a couple of hours and a couple of men who knew what they were doing to install it, and the size of the hole in the wall had to be modified to fit this unit, but, once done, it has been awesome! This unit is powerful enough to effectively cool the whole house, except for one room (the master bedroom which has its own window unit). I am very, very pleased with this Frigidaire product and the remote control is wonderful, as the location of the unit makes it difficult for all of the family members to access the front panel to adjust the settings.

After days of reading reviews on Amazon and looking at dehumidifiers in the flesh locally, I decided on the PerfectAire found at my local Ace Hardware. It was tempting to save a few bucks by buying the 30 gallon model, but I resisted the temptation.At first the PerfectAire disappointed until I read in the directions to initially run the unit in the continuous mode. It's been smooth sailing since.The dehumidifier is in our cathedral ceilinged living room and set at 40% humidity. Amazingly it reaches that level in short order and then cycles on and off until the reservoir is filled. The turn off is smooth, not the loud herky-jerky event I've experienced with other dehumidifiers.I like the easy to monitor visual on the front that alerts the user at all times to how much water is in the tank. You must be careful emptying the tank. First it is very heavy since it holds a lot of water. Second you must be careful because the bottom is not totally flat so the tank can tip backwards making a mess.  There is no curved pouring spout on the water tank so I've found it best to empty it in the bathtub or take it outside for the plants. The tank fills up about every 12 hours for us.I would have given the PerfectAire five stars but:It's not nearly as quiet as I had hoped. It's as loud as a fan running on medium and is even louder running in the turbo mode.This dehumidifier throws off a lot of heat, more than the replaced Soleus did and more than the old dehumidifier I have in the basement. For this reason you wouldn't want to place this unit in a small, enclosed area. When I first set up the unit, it was within four feet of the thermostat. The blast of hot air was hitting the thermostat with such force that it raised the temperature five degrees. Moving the dehumidifier solved the problem.Bottom line - This dehumidifier really sucks the water out of the air. Just don't sit next to it when watching TV, and don't use it in a small, enclosed room.\",\n",

What sets the HERA brand apart from the rest?The HERA Ultrasonic Humidifier has touchpad controls that allow the user to customize the humidifier settings to their own preferences.  The humidifier has a warm mist feature that helps take the cold, wet feeling out of the room.  There is the option of three different output levels.  The humidifier can be set up to shut off when it reaches a predetermined humidity level and there is a digital hygrometer to show you the humidity level of the room.  The night mode will dim the LCD display if the light bothers you at night.  The unit is equipped with a filter cartridge meant to reduce the hardness level of your water and an ionic silver cube meant to help keep the water bacteria free.I personally found most of the functions on the humidifier pretty intuitive.  I did have to refer to the manual a few times to figure out exactly what certain buttons did.  I felt that the manual was very poorly designed.  I thought the content of the manual was fine, but the layout of the manual was not very user friendly in my opinion.  While I did not have problems figuring out how to fill the tank, my wife did have to take some time to figure out where the water went.There were some things I really liked about the unit.  I thought the output level of the unit was powerful.  On the highest setting with the unit 2 feet off the ground, the water did not evaporate before it hit the ground.  I thought the unit was very aesthetically pleasing.  It is an attractive box form that can fit in a number of areas easily.  I thought the warm mist was a nice option that I felt made a difference in the feel of the air in the room.  One of the things I liked best was that the tank is square, which makes for easy filling.  I have had other shaped tanks that were a pain to try and hold while filling with several gallons of water.The hygrometer seemed to be fairly accurate for the most part.  I put another hygrometer in the same room and the readings were pretty close.  The only exception to this is when I filled the tank.  The hygrometer on the humidifier would read too high for a few minutes after filling the tank.  If the auto mode is being utilized, it will usually shut off until the reading corrects itself.What I did not like about the unit is the concept of the filter cartridge.  I live in an area with pretty hard water.  There is a water softener in my house, but I know many people do not have one.  I have used ultrasonic humidifiers for years before I put my water softener in and I will admit after about 3 or 4 winters, I will usually have to clean the humidifier out with vinegar and a soft brush.  While the idea of the filter cartridge did intrigue me,  it is a disposable part and one that might need to be changed frequently.The humidifier comes with a test strip.  The test strip appears to be German and measures in units of Degrees of Hardness (dH) and the instructions measures water hardness in \"pink boxes.\"  I took a sample of untreated water in my house and using test strips, I measured it to be about 250 ppm (parts per million) or about 15 gpg (grains per gallon).  Using the provided test strip, it measured about 17 dH or about 3.5 pink boxes.  In my later research, I found that the gpg and dH measurements are not identical, but for this purpose, they are close enough to use interchangeably.So why am I spending so much time talking about water hardness?  The filter cartridge life is dependant on water hardness.  With 15gpg/17dH water hardness level at my house without the water softener, I can expect the filter cartridge to last for 20 to 40 gallons of water or 10 to 20 fills of the tank.  At the time of this writing, a Stadler Form A-112 replacement cartridge runs $15 to $20.  The Stadler Form Replacement Ionic Silver Cube is supposed to be replaced annually and currently that runs another $25.My treated water is about 1 gpg.  According to the manual, at this hardness level, the filter should last about 115 gallons of water or about 58 fills.While I liked the humidifier, the price of replacement cartridges and silver cubes can be quite expensive.  Both of these items are optional to use, but if you take those aspects away, then this is just another ultrasonic humidifier and then there are many more cost effective alternatives available.  Those alternatives might not be as stylish and the controls might not be as user friendly, but when it comes down to it, without the filter cartridge, my $50 Sunbeam has most of the same functions as this one.Overall, I thought it was an excellent product worthy of 5 stars.  However, keep in mind that there is potentially quite an expense to utilize the product to its full potential.  For that, I am deducting 2 stars.',\n",

       " 'B0063QENSK': {'Best review': 'My other vacuum is a high-end Kirby so much of my analysis will be a comparison between the two. We\\'ve had the Kirby for years and it is a workhorse; however, I wanted a vacuum that was a little more manueverable especially on the hardwood floors.  The Sebo is easy to use but does not have an auto drive feature so it is quite a workout to vacuum regular wall-to-wall carpeting.  The wood floors and area rugs are a breeze, though, and this vacuum actually handles them better than my Kirbly which can be a bit unwieldy.  I like the Sebo\\'s ease of use around corners and tight spots.  The swivel action is wonderful.  The low-profile head is particularly useful for reaching under the dining room chairs and the family room coffee table.  The head is so low to the ground that it even reaches under a few inches of my refrigerator and under the lower kitchen cabinets all the way to the baseboards, something my Kirby can\\'t do with it\\'s giant head.I think the Sebo does a better job on my low-pile area rugs, it really gets them clean (great suction) without \"sucking\" them up like the Kirby does.  Downside is that you have to reach down to the head to switch the head height to go between floor types.  On the Kirby there is a foot peddle which has spoiled me.  One bonus is that the Sebo has an indicator like that tells you if the setting is too high.  Very convenient.  The Sebo also offers a variable suction control but I\\'m not sure why you wouldn\\'t want full suction power.  Also, the Sebo is quite a bit quieter than my Kirby and doesn\\'t frighten the dog as much.I haven\\'t tried emptying it yet but I\\'m sure I will appreciate not needing to special order Hepa filters for it like I do for the Kirby.  The Seba will likely become my main downstairs vacuum where we have a lot of hardwood flooring and the Kirby will go upstairs where it is almost all carpeting.  Can\\'t say that I relish the idea of pushing the Sebo around all that carpet, my biceps would be huge. :)Final Verdict:  The Sebo seems to be a very good machine and I hope it will last for years as it is not an inexpensive machine.  My only caution is the lack of auto-drive.  If you are not a strong person and plan to use this on large expanses of push carpeting, you should probably keep shopping.',\n",

We had another little orange one from a major vac manufacturer name, and it was just about useless.  This wins, no questions asked.  You have some maintenance to do, like any vacuum.  You wash and dry the foamy filter.  You need to wash out the inner tank sometimes.  You will have to cut the hair and such from the beater bar.  And you will sometimes need to disconnect the top from the bottom and &#34;fish&#34; through the little suction tunnel from top to bottom.We have a german shepherd, and she sheds like there is no tomorrow.  We use this daily to keep the hardwood floors and tile floors of the first floor clean.  And it works on surface dirt on the carpet that is on the stairs.  It isn't something that gets down deep into pile carpet, but for surface dirt it works great.  And on hardwoods, there is nothing better.Our Shark Navigator Pro is also a winner.  That is mostly used upstairs and for deep cleaning the area rugs downstairs  every so often as this little one cannot get deep down into carpets.The battery still gets at least 20 minutes of use before it stops working.  This is consistent with when it was new, and it is over 2 years old now.  Do yourself a favor and buy this.  It works, and it works great.

They are very simple, but they complete the task perfectly.  Using them is easy, you just snap the two pieces around the bag and push them together.  They do an excellent job.  In fact, if you left air in the bag and try to push it out after placing the clip you likely will not be getting the air out.You can use them for crackers, chips, snack bags, bread (much better than the standard bread ties), and just about anything else.  You can also seal liquids in bags, but I'd be careful.  If the bag is really slick and the contents are heavy, there is a possibility it'd slip out of the clip.The clips can be measured and trimmed to suit your needs, but I'd just recommend buying various sizes.  The best thing about these clips is that they cannot be broken.  There are not any springs or flimsy plastic parts like the standard chip clips.

The shelving I had in there for 10 years was the 18\" deep shelving from Costco mostly.

       " 'B00440EKRG': {'Best review': 'You may think that you would be crazy to spend $300 on this thing...I mean, this thing is massive, unattractive, and expensive. It also generates heat and uses a good bit of energy when on higher settings and ran 24-7. So why would you pay $300 for this ugly thing when you can get smaller and \\'stylish\\' air purifiers for the same price that are also rated for larger rooms?I can tell you why this $300 hunk of ugly is worth every penny. I had asthma when younger. I have bad allergies. I have multiple medical conditions that are aggravated by environmental contaminants and certain air-borne particular matter. I\\'ve owned tons of air filters. I\\'ve owned many of the \\'experimental\\' purifiers such as the Ionic Breeze. And I\\'ve found most models on the market to seriously suck. In terms of real-world performance, HEPA is the only way to go.The filter is MASSIVE. The filter is a REAL HEPA. The 0.3 micron rating is exactly what you want...many of the other home products are 3 micron...the difference in .3 versus 3.0 is the difference in the filter effectively trapping particles that can make one ill versus simply recirculating these particles back into the air you then breath. The amount of air this thing moves is tremendous. It\\'s CEDR rating blows everything else at this price-point away (and note that many of the other models rated for larger rooms have a much lower CEDR rating, or no CEDR rating listed visibly on the box, or at all). This is one of the few home products that really CAN effectively handle large rooms. So you have a unit with good turnover and exceptional filtration, which is what you want if you are serious about air quality.I dislike how \"HEPA\" is so loosely used in the industry...many good people have been deceived by makers with questionable integrity. A REAL HEPA filter MUST remove AT LEAST 99.97% of airborne particles 0.3 micrometers (m) in diameter. A stat on a box saying \"removes 99.97% of particles\" is a useless figure because the particle size is omitted. It quickly becomes clear that many of the \"HEPA\", \"HEPA-grade\" or \"HEPA-efficiency\" or \"HEPA-spec\" or maker-created terms that include the word \"HEPA\" ARE NOT REAL HEPA FILTERS. What are the implications of this? Harm to the end-user...especially those with medical conditions needing good filtration. Someone with asthma, allergies, environmental sensitivities, or a condition that is flared by environmental contaminants will live a greater quality of life with good filtration...and a lower quality filter can actually aggravate as it pulls settled particles into the air and recirculates them rather than trapping. A true HEPA from a product with a high CEDR rating will make a massive improvement over a filter which is not a true HEPA. We can talk numbers all day long, but the biggest difference is one that the end user themselves will experience. While this is more pronounced with people who have medical conditions, it is something everyone will notice. Remember, indoor air is NOT of high quality.The controls are easy to use. The manual is not overly long, but also not to brief you are left with questions you have to take to the internet to answer via hours of your own time. The product is made by Whirlpool...the brand is known for usually making good quality stuff and standing behind their products. The AP51030K seems to continue their trend of high quality products. It is important to note that the pre-filter is more of a pre-filter than a carbon filter. By that I mean it traps larger particles that would otherwise shorten the lifespan of the HEPA filter significantly. In terms of carbon filtration to remove odors, the amount of carbon in this unit does NOT make it well-suited for serious odor removal. Therefore, this unit is better suited to users wanting to filter the particles that cause breathing/allergy issues than the users looking for something to remove odors. Use of more than 1 pre-filter may be possible, but I have not tried it as I don\\'t use it for that purpose...please note that I would advise contacting the maker before attempting this, as it can impact flow dynamics and may or may not be safe for the motor. Like most high-efficiency filters, it should be cleaned and cleaned often. Removing visible debris from the pre-filter will extend the life of the pre-filter, the HEPA filter, and the motor (by decreasing flow-resistance caused by larger particulate matter).So is $300 worth it? Absolutely. As of today, the best all-around filtration is a true HEPA...and you need a sizable filter and a sizable motor. Therefore, any good filter will have a larger form-factor. The AP51030K is pure performance and while it is by no means cheap, its performance outclasses many filters that cost significantly more. For the home user, it is arguably the best choice on the market in terms of cost versus performance. Ionic filtration such as the Ionic Breeze simply sucks. I\\'ve owned them and they are a waste. I\\'ve owned many non-HEPA models and their effectiveness is usually outright poor. I\\'ve owned many lesser quality filters and they are a waste. Stick with a true HEPA. The real-life outcomes speak for themselves, and the best way to see this first hand is to try it yourself. For that person in your life with asthma or allergies, the HEPA filter is as major of a breakthrough as the inhaler or anti-histamines. In this sense, the high price of the AP51030K is 100% justifiable because IT IS AN INVESTMENT FOR GOOD HEALTH.',\n",
       "  'description': \"The Whirlpool AP51030K features a three-stage filtration system comprised of a pre-filter, carbon filter, and true HEPA filter. The air purifier&#x2019;s outside grill acts as a permanent pre-filter by capturing large particles and preventing them from entering the unit. Large particles that find their way inside the unit are promptly caught by the carbon filter, which also works to eliminate unwanted odors and protect the life of the HEPA filter. At the heart of the Whirlpool Whispure 510 is true HEPA filtration. HEPA filters provide maximum filtration of your room's air by removing up to 99.97% of particles that are 0.3 microns and larger. These particles include pet dander, dust mites, pollen, ragweed, mold spores, and other microscopic irritants that can damage your indoor air quality and aggravate allergy and asthma symptoms.\",\n",

I bought the first because it had a large tank, has a prodigious mist output, and a relatively small footprint. This unit has been in operation for over two years now and works perfectly well. I find them to be very reliable and requiring little maintenance. The small fan in the unit is sufficient to move the mist across a room with no real effort. Because of this experience, I've bought two more. It is necessary to clean the transducer on a regular basis as it does tend to accumulate a mineral scale that reduces the efficiency of the mist production. A solution of vinegar and water will disolve the scale pretty well so that the transducer can be cleaned using a tooth brush. I find that running at 40% for 12 hours a day, the tank will last about 4 days before needing to be refilled. My major complaint is that the tank is difficult to fill. It is fairly tall and needs to be filled from the bottom. But, as the top is not flat,it will not rest under the faucet so you have to be a bit creative holding the tank to fill it. I find that the only faucet in my condo tall enough to fill the tank is my bathtub so that is a bit inconvenient. since the unit does put out a fair amount of mist, I would caution against setting it too high. I would think that for an average room a setting of about 30-40% might be sufficient.Pro's: Good mist output, no filter, small footprint, open base design makes cleaning easy, quiet.Con's: Somewhat difficult to fill, output is not directional; shoots straight up, simple controls; just like the volume control on a radio, no humidistat, no power on light\",\n",

By the time I finally got around to ordering this, the price had dropped an additional $20.00.And of course, shipping was free.My item arrived on time and the packaging appeared to be in good order.

I contacted Amazon immediately via Chat and was offered a full refund and  free return or a partial refund to compensate for the damage.  I opted for the partial refund (20%) and repaired the damage myself within minutes.The vacuum arrived with one bag already in the body of the vacuum plus one additional bag.  Likewise, it arrived with one belt installed with an additional replacement belt.While the pet brush is okay, the crevice tool and the standard brush are below par but serviceable. The cord and the hose are longer than most competitors' and the vacuum handles as well as any I've ever used and has a solid feel. Suction is beyond criticism.What impressed me most was how quiet this vacuum is.  No ear piercing, dog aggravating scream as with others I've owned or used (Bissell, Hoover, Dirt Devil.

For background, I own three upright vacuums and three Ergorapido vacuums and am a bit of a vacuum junkie.My imprssions:For a sub hundred dollar vacuum, I think the Hoover performs well and is a good value.Relatively this is a quiet vacuum that's easy to maneuver and pushes smoothly. The power button is conveniently placed on the handle.I am impressed by the suction and pick up of this vacuum. We had four dogs in the home during my visit and plenty of dog hair. This Windtunnel did an amazing job picking up the dog hair, and I was amazed by the amount of hair it picked up.Emptying the dirt container is easy and convenient. Flip a button and the bottom opens up to release the collected dirt and hair. The filtrations system of the Hoover is also a nice feature as is the rotating brush attachment for the hose.I missed not having a light on the vacuum, but certainly wouldn't consider this omission a deal breaker.Bottom line - I enjoyed using the Hoover bagless for a week and was favorably impressed. This model is worth considering, especially for those who prefer a bagless model.\",\n",

       " 'B000FA74SQ': {'Best review': \"Pops fast with a little amount of oil.I also have the plain silver colored popper and I have had no issues with this red one.  They have worked the same for me.My husband choose one as a holiday gift at his work a few years ago from the group of $20 gifts. He knows how much I love popcorn. At first I was skeptical because it feels cheap and flimsy. We had been using a really old, large, very cheap, covered stock pot. It belonged to his grandmother and worked so well because it had thin walls and a thin floor. It was light and easy to shake and it would build up steam and heat quickly in the aluminum pot. But it wasn't designed for popcorn and the small handles would get scorching. The big plus side is that I could make an enormous amount of popcorn in it at once.This Wabash Valley Farms Whirley-Pop device has the same important features of thin metal that hold in steam for rapid heat production. The pot will not have to heat up like a heavier pot would. This popper allows the heat to go directly and quickly into the oil and get changed to steam, which can be the most effective for popping the most kernels. The whirley stirring feature is an added bonus that permits you to keep unpopped and partially popped kernels in contact with the highest heat sources (oil and steam) instead of getting trapped by the popped kernels. The ability for the lid to flip up is practical if you end up with a lot of popped corn so it has some place to go and make room for more kernels to get big and fluffy.Because this popper helps create and retain high heat, you do not need much oil and you do not need a super high heat setting once the oil gets warmed. As the popping begins, be ready as it will finish quickly. I usually use less than a tablespoon of vegatable oil, such as Wesson canola oil. It leaves almost no taste and this is very little oil for the amount of popcorn you can make. It will not look like it has coated the bottom the pot while it is cool. That is my only complaint - I wish it had a larger capacity.Once the popping is going strong, turn down the heat setting, and begin cranking the whirley handle. It will finish popping in about a minute or less. If you covered the bottom of the pot with good popcorn kernels, such as Orville white (my favorite), the sides of the lids should be poking up and it may be getting a little difficult to whirl because the pot is FULL of fluffy popcorn.Transfer your popcorn to a bowl for your desired seasoning. I think that seasoning/buttering your popcorn is best when it is warm and fresh (unless you are saving it to make popcorn balls). Clean up is easy. The lid flops around because of the whirley turner and is a bit awkward to clean, but simple. The pot is super straight-forward. All clean with soap and water and rinse out well.Here are some of my tips, as a popcorm lover and chef for your homemade popcorn enjoyment:**Salt popcorn BEFORE adding any butter or butter substitute. The salt will stick to any additional oils that are poured on the popcorn and tend to glop in places and some will taste super salty while others bland.**Whatever you do to the popcorn after it's popped, disperse it evening by shaking the popcorn and seasoning/butter together in a large covered container. It is like tossing a caesar salad.**If you like butter - use butter. There is no real substitute. Use small amounts and use the shake method after salting. Try pouring the melted butter down the sides of the container and add the popcorn and then shake. This way you avoid some kernels with a lot of butter and other without - unless you want that. It helps with even coating so you use less but achieve high flavor.**Try a unique salt blend such as a maple bbq salt rub that you would put on your ribs. Tossing your popcorn with a little goes a long way for a spicy, savory treat. Mesquite rubs are also yummy! Lawrys has several commercial options.**Drizzle the sides of your shaking container with small amounts of ice cream sundae caramel. Toss in your salted popcorn and shake away. This will coat your popcorn for a salty, lightly sweetened surprise. (you could try chocolate sauce too, but not too much)**If you like kettle corn, try mixing a bit of light corn syrup with sesame oil and toss with the popcorn in your shaking container. Then toss with a bit of sugar and salt to taste. You need the corn syrup and oil to help the sugar and salt stick, but use a light hand with all of these additions. It is supposed to be reminiscent of kettle corn without cooking it in a kettle.Here's to the fun of popping!!\",\n",

Yes, there was a lot we had to clarify there because there are several ways other brands try to deceive consumers. Egyptian cotton is superior to most other sheet material because of the long-staple. While the long-staple can be found in other cottons, it is most predominantly found in Egyptian grown cotton. This long-staple allows the cotton to be woven more extensively, creating a softer and more durable sheet that is resistant to pilling. The carefully crafted weave makes Egyptian cotton sheets more breathable. You can see why authentic Egyptian cotton sheets are so desirable; unfortunately, a lot of consumers are tricked into purchasing inferior products.Most Oversized DimensionsMalouf manufactures their linens to the most oversized dimensions available. Fitted sheets accommodate mattress depths from 6 to 22 inches, perfect for thick mattresses or beds with mattress toppers. The ultra-thick fitted sheet elastic goes all the way around the mattress to guarantee a secure fit. Malouf\\'s Right-Fit elastic ensures the fully elasticized fitted sheet will fit and stay on any mattress 6-22 inches thick.Superb WorkmanshipMalouf\\'s Egyptian cotton is finely woven to produce a true 400 thread count, but thread count alone is not the best way to measure Egyptian cotton quality. The single-ply cotton is mercerized to strengthen the fibers, give them a more lustrous appearance and a softer feel. Designed in the U.S., imported materials were used to provide the highest levels of quality and comfort.

I read the glowing report from another buyer and based my purchase on that, so I hope hers are better. My Mom reports that the songbird sheets are great, very soft and even a bit oversized to allow for shrinking. So maybe my set was a fluke or made at a different plant. It does appear the songbirds are a good set.I got the princess set for myself...I've never grown up. LOL. I will say they are soft to the touch no complaint there. They are not very thick but then they tell you 135gms. They only have elastic on the corners of the fitted sheets and that to me is disappointing as I find those to not stay put as well. The top sheet doesn't have much drop on the sides. They measure 11 inches deep at the corner and my mattress and pad topper together measure  12 inches so these pop off during the night.  They are a tight fit on my full bed with a 3 inch memory foam topper. They do not go under the top mattesss. As far as sleeping on them they are comfy and smooth. I just don't expect them to last years like Northern Nights from QVC that I am used to. For eight dollars and eleven cents they are worth that, but not when it comes to them popping off. They have to go back:{  So be aware if you have a mattress thicker than 10 inches these are not going to hug under the mattress unless my set was just a fluke.They are made in Pakistan not China that is a good point. I guess I am used to Portugal made flannel which is supposed to be the best. So all in all for the sale prices they are worth that much if your mattress in not too thick.

It's a bit small if you have a very thick mattress, but the overall nice look makes up for the gaps at the corners and probably isn't an issue with an average mattress. Some people had concerns about wrinkling--personally I think ironing it is a waste. The one pillowcase and the bed skirt are sort of a seersucker material and actually look quite cute (in my opinion) with the puckered wrinkles. However the pilling on the quilt is really an issue. The backside of the cranberry quilt is white, and after two washes I began getting hundreds of tiny white pills all over the cranberry side. I guess the backside is coming off and pilling up on the colored side. If you are going to put this in a guest room and never sit on top of it, you will not need to wash it very often, and have no pets, I would recommend it. But if it's going to get regular use, I would definitely not suggest it for the cost. I've had this just a few months for my daybed (which I use regularly) in my living area, and I'm going to have to purchase a matching cranberry throw to cover it, because it looks pretty shabby unless I lint-roller it daily and take a sweater de-piller to it after washing. Once the quilt dies (I'm guessing it will have to go in about six more months) I'll get something hardier for the top.\",\n",

I was looking for a better way to store them and I finally settled on this.  I ordered the red one, not for any particular reason other than that it was the least expensive color available at the time.First of all, just to be clear, you will have to supply your own hanger.  This was not a problem for me as I have many extras.  I used a standard-sized plastic clothes hanger and it was fine.  It's in there pretty well and should support the weight of my jewelry, even when I fill this organizer up.  (It's really not very heavy, even partially filled.)  I hang mine on a bar in the closet so both sides are easily accessible.Another thing to note: the pockets do not seal, so if you were planning to store silver in here, there is a chance it will tarnish.  (I don't have much fine jewelry; most of mine is the &#34;fashion&#34; kind, so I don't have any tarnish problems.)  Because the pockets are open at the top, this would also not be a suitable jewelry carrier for travel.Finally, the loops on the back are sewn such that your necklace must have a clasp in order to use them (i.e., there's no Velcro closure, they're just loops of fabric); the loops are hung in straight vertical rows, so some longer necklaces will be on top of others.None of the things I have mentioned are a big deal for me, so I won't subtract from my rating because of those features.  But if those things are important to you, now you know!Two criticisms that do impact my rating: the color of mine is absolutely not the red color in the photo.  It's a dark (almost hot) pink.  I believe insufficient dye was used and this was the result.Second, and more importantly, the very first pocket I tried to use was not properly sealed/sewn at the bottom and could not actually hold any jewelry.  All of the other ones I've tested since then have been fine.The pockets are big enough for single strand bracelets and sets of five or fewer bangles.  Larger sets of bangle bracelets will need to go into the bottom row of pockets as these are a little larger.  Large earrings would also work in most of the pockets although using this for stud earrings would probably be overkill.Anyway, the one defective pocket is not a big enough problem for me to send this back.  (I can probably mend it with some tape if I'm so inclined.)  This works well enough for my purposes and with the amount of jewelry I have at this time.  However, I probably wouldn't buy the same item again.\",\n",

The on and off switch is on the back and when it hits the wall it often shuts off. It's also difficult to get the sensor to open the lid and you have to bend down to activate it.

No more touching your dirty filter to clean it out. And, because you are enhancing your filtration system by cleaning out the filter, one turn of the dial turns up the suction power by 80%.  Additionally, the new 15.6 volt DustBuster also has a HEPA filter, the first cordless hand held in the marketplace. HEPA filters are the highest efficiency air filters available for the filtration of small particles. Defined by the Institute of Environmental Science, a Certified HEPA filter must capture a minimum of 99.97% of contaminants. Allergies? No problem!\",\n",

       "  'description': 'This Aller Ease allergen barrier pillow cover provides added relief for allergy sufferers without changing the surface comfort of pillows. Sewn from 100 percent combed upland cotton, the case uses an extraordinarily tight weave to keep allergy-triggering dust and dust mites from escaping the pillow. Air and moisture still pass through the barrier, so it breathes well, as does the allergic sleeper. Smooth and soft, the pillow cover has a thread count of 240 for suppleness and durability. It closes with a zipper for added security and is machine-washable for convenience. White for maximum versatility, the piece comes in standard, queen, and king sizes.

Indeed, since we have beige towels to begin with and my samples came in beige, I actually thought I might have been using one of our older towels as I dried off on my first test - a quick check for the logo assured me I wasn't, but it was certainly a testament to the quality of the fabric used for these.A few dunks in the washer and drier later revealed that they retained their &#34;thirstiness&#34; with no perceivable loss of fabric softness.After a week of use, I can honestly say these towels are a keeper. They perform as well as towels twice their price, and being a seasoned luxury brand owner, I had difficulty telling them apart aside from a logo. That's enough for me.Get them.

The holes were started, but they were not deep enough to get the screws in at all - and my husband is a strong guy!  These were also the two most difficulty set screws, and had they slid in as easily as all the other hardware, it would have been perfect.  Luckily I had just bought my husband a new drill bit set at the hardware store, and he had the perfect size to use without messing the holes or the wood at all.  Once put together, this is indeed a strong, sturdy bed.  Husband weights about 220 - 6 ft. tall.  I am about 110, 5 foot 2 inches tall.  There is no creaking or squeaking when we sleep - and we do sleep!  We just moved five weeks ago and left our old, twenty plus years queen size mattress and box spring, with a metal frame underneath, behind.  We swore no more metal frames to bang our toes and knees on.  This wood is simply beautiful - I plan to add a bit of shellac to the legs, but that's it.  We bought some felt pads to stick on the bottom of the legs and the bed is so easy to move on the hardwood floors this way.  As my husband is 78 and I am mid fifties - it took the two of us about an hour to put the bed together, along with the frame.  We had purchased an extra firm queen size mattress which rests nicely on this hardwood platform frame - no boxspring needed.  It would have elevated the mattress over the headboard, which is now the perfect height against our pillows.  The two of us have had our best sleep in years!As other reviewers stated, the holes line up beautifully and it's a snap almost to put together.  We ended up with six extra screws, good to hold on to just in case.UPDATE:  Am sticking with the four stars for the reason stated above.  We've had the bed over a year now and have had no problems with it.  Occasionally, we tighten the screws, which is simple and easy to do when changing sheets.  It's the first bed I've had that I haven't bruised my feet or knees on when trying to make the bed or change sheets.  I purchased a single frame without headboard for my daughter, and was able to put it together by myself in about 20 minutes.  The wood has held up on our bed - and it's perfect.\",\n",

I wasn't setting out to like this product as much as I did but now I am going to be purchasing another one for the guest bathroom.  Why the change of heart?  For me it was rather simple...  Hand soap for our family of 5 lasts longer because the children are no longer pumping away without recourse.  The second point was the fact that my bathroom sink was no longer messy from soap squirts that had congealed.  I was put at task every few days to clean the sticky disaster that the kids would leave me; now if they could figure out how to stop the globs of toothpaste every morning and night!Our sample soap lasted 1 1/2 months and the batteries are still going strong.  The Simple Human branded soap doesn't seem to be too expensive considering that you are receiving two 34 oz packages via Amazon's Subscribe & Save program.  The refills packages also have an easy-pour spout unlike the sample provided with the product.Pros:*No Dripping!  Does not drip at all.*Works wonderfully with the free Lavender sample provided.  Also worked with my Lavender Method hand soap without clogging or dripping.*Can be easily turned off by holding down the (-) sign for three seconds.*Germ-free user operation if you aren't turning it on and off.*You can regulate and monitor the amount that each individual is dispensed by pressing the (+)(-) signs to desired amount.*Soap lasts longer because of the set amount that is dispensed.*Quiet operation.*Clean operation that saves me precious clean up time.*Motivates the young ones to wash their hands because of the 'magic'!*Small foot stamp that does not get knocked over like regular soap dispensers.Cons:*Top plastic chrome constantly has water spots/stains.  Driving me crazy.*If placed very closely to the edge rim of the sink then just washing your hands under the water spout can activate and waste soap. (we remedied by placing it very far back from the edge since it does not drip/leak)*The previous pro became a con when during a recent get-together, the kids gathered in the bathroom to 'wash' their hands rather enthusiastically.  Never have I seen such clean little hands.  Wasted soap.*Thicker soaps and Bath & Body Works beads clog the nozzle a bit.*A bit expensive if you are planning on replacing all the manual pumps throughout your household.Highly recommend for those that are concerned with germs and have young children in their home that waste soap without supervision.  This has changed our washing hands habits and has made it a motivator for everyone to always remember to wash their hands.

       " 'B004W7CLBS': {'Best review': \"Let's begin with some Words of Wisdom: Unless you know what pillow you want, buy from Bed Bath and Beyond. They are one of the few retailers that accepts returns of the Tempurpedic pillows (just don't open the plastic wrap!) and you can use a 20% off coupon! Yay!When I purchased my Cloud mattress, I received two symphony pillows for free with the cotton lining and cover-- not the new polyester covers/lining. I was told by a sales woman that nothing has changed about the pillows themselves over than the lining and cover.The Symphony pillows were firm at first, but they break in after about a week, and they've held up great for the last three years. But there is ONE problem: I get annoyed at the contoured sides that are made for different sleep positions. You have to flip the pillow if you are moving from your back to your side to be comfortable and if you don't-- ouch! My neck! Otherwise, it's an AMAZING pillow. It wouldn't be so big of a deal for me if I woke up, but I don't. I wake up when my neck starts to hurt. (insert sad face now). It's also not the best for a stomach sleeper.My Goal: find a pillow that I could use on my stomach, side AND back (I know lofty goals) that would give me the support that I needed without having to flip it over multiple times a night. (For reference, I'm a small woman-- just over 5 ft and I have a small frame)Now let's get to the Pillow Talk:Latex: soft and all sorts of springy with minimal to moderate support. I found that no latex pillow I've used gives me enough support. This is my preference, of course. I prefer memory foam. I don't like springy.After that latex fiasco, I went back to good ole tempur-pedic.My old standby-- the Symphony: medium firmness, very little spring. Great for side sleepers, but if you switch positions a lot-- this pillow can get annoying because you have to keep flipping it. Also, it's not great for stomach sleepers. If you are a side sleeper or a back sleeper-- you won't be sorry that you got this pillow. This actually reminds me the most of the Cloud mattress because it has a little bit of softness initially, but then it forms to your body just like the mattress does. It's very comfy with lots of support.Cloud: very soft, yet supportive, but springy. However, the &#34;springy-ness&#34; is a problem for me because the foam wants to rebound back into it's natural form. That makes my head tilt at an angle instead of lay flat which hurts my neck. This pillow looks lofty, but it has a lot of give when you put your head on it. It turns out to be about the same height as my symphony so I know it's not the height that's a problem-- I think it's the amount of recoil in this pillow which is an issue. It is incredibly soft and it wanted so badly for it to be MY pillow, but it wasn't. It is, however, very moldable and this pillow can work for stomach sleepers if you're willing to put half the pillow under your chest. Not ideal, but it can work because it's so pliable.Curve: firmest of the bunch, but a bit thinner than the Symphony and the Cloud. It is better if you're an &#34;every position&#34; sleeper including a stomach sleeper. The first night-- it's a bit hard, but the pillow gets softer with use. I'm not talking like it's so soft that you feel like your head is on a marshmallow (if that's your goal-- get the cloud), but if you've laid on tempurpedic mattresses, then you know what I mean: it molds to you and it becomes soft. I also kind of like the curve in the shape because it's actually difficult to fall off the pillow.  If you get the curve, then you should definitely get a Queen size because the standards are freakishly small.I thought about getting the traditional pillow, but it really seemed to mushy when I was playing with it at the store. If you can, I really recommend making a trip out to a store where you can at least play around with these pillows before you make that $100+ decision.Also, I live in Florida and I've never felt &#34;hot&#34; using a memory foam pillow. If that's a concern-- then I don't think any of these pillows will be a problem. AND the smell will go away in a couple of days. ;)Hopefully this helps you make the decision that's best for you!\",\n",

I tried this out on the soda stain and what was left when my furball left me a furball on my bedroom carpet.  I went over it with this machine several times and it did not get the stains out.  They were still clearly visible when I was done.  I have had a Bissell ProHeat for about a year now and I absolutely love it (so much that I bought my mom one a few months ago).  When I finished earlier with this carpet cleaner, I thought to myself, \"These stains would be nothing for my Bissell ProHeat 2X.\"  Later I had to prove it to myself so I went ahead and pulled out my ProHeat and the stains came right out.  The brushes work so much better.  I hate to compare the machines like this, but for just a few extra dollars, you can get a really fantastic machine and I think it is worth it to guide you to that.  If you are concerned about the carpet being wet, there is a ProHeat model that comes with dryers as well.  This carpet cleaner is easy to maneuver but the water tank is so small.

The unit's TLR PowerRoller floor brush not only lifts, traps, and removes dirt and debris from carpets and area rugs, but it also absorbs the majority of the cleaning spray from the machine for fast drying in less than 30 minutes.

The PROdry is a home cleaning system that uses a combination of hot tap water, Bissell advanced deep cleaning formulas, the TLR PowerRoller, and suction to safely and effectively clean carpets and area rugs. In additional to trapping, lifting, and removing the dirt and grime, the TLR PowerRoller absorbs the majority of the water and formula, meaning your carpet and area rugs dry in less than 30 minutes!Why Should I Buy a Bissell Carpet Cleaning Machine?Bissell manufactures a variety of upright and portable deep cleaners in addition to the PROdry fast drying carpet cleaner. No other manufacturer of home cleaning machines is more experienced in the category. Bissell cleaning machines are recognized as the high quality standard of the industry with ease of use, performance and durability engineered into each unit, every step of the way.How Does the Prodry Fast Drying Carpet Cleaner Work?PROdry uses a new technology to easily and effectively clean your carpet and area rugs.

PROdry relies on the TLR PowerRoller to minimize the amount of water that comes in contact with the carpet surface. So you get the benefits of carpet cleaning, without the disruption of waiting for your carpet to dry.How Often Do I Need to Replace the TLR Powerroller?The TLR PowerRoller can be hand washed between uses to prolong its life. Under normal use conditions it should last approximately 6 months.Can I Clean Spots and Stains, or Even Stairs with the PROdry?PROdry comes with a long, ready to use hose that stores right on the machine.

Unfortunately for me, while living in this country I found it virtually impossible to find an authentic Japanese buckwheat pillow, so I decided to create and manufacture my own based on my own lifetime experience. I have been using buckwheat pillows just like the one I\\'m selling here, since I was a small child in Japan, and I can\\'t sleep without it! I believe that once you try this pillow you will never sleep on a \"regular\" pillow again! No more tossing and turning all night long! You will feel the difference that buckwheat hulls make. These are the best Buckwheat Pillows. High QUALITY, designed, and fabricated by genuine Japanese. I\\'ve hand picked the very best American grown buckwheat hulls, they are locally grown and harvested, and they have been cleaned using a triple cleaning process to remove dust, buckwheat flour, and debris from amongst the hulls. 100% organic, grown totally without pesticides or herbicides. Nothing, absolutely-no additives. I use the highest quality 100% unbleached cotton fabric for the pillow case, comfortable texture, very durable yet very smooth to sleep on. Also, this pillow includes a zipper to allow you the option of removing hulls and adjusting the pillow to fit your exact needs.',\n",

       " 'B007N6ZDUQ': {'Best review': '[Update June 2014:  Still running fine.  Since last winter was so warm, I kept the AC in the window until January.  The AC runs 24x7 for over 6 months of the year.  Even when the weather is nice, we still run the AC due to the pollen.]I\\'ve been running this AC for about 3 weeks. The AC runs non-stop in the bedroom -- I live in the South and the humidity is very high during the summer.I love this A/C; the A/C removes gallons of water daily and I actually like the sound of the fan as a very nice white noise generator.  I\\'m not sure if the weather is cooler this year than previous years but month after month, my electrical bill has significantly dropped (compared to previous years) after I installed several small window A/C units.Although I have a working HVAC, I prefer window AC units because I want to tailor the temperature of each room and I don\\'t heat or cool some extra rooms unless we have company.  The other reason why I use window AC units is that they are far more energy efficient than a well-maintained HVAC system.  My electric bills are dramatically lower when I use Energy Star window AC units (they pay themselves off in just one month).As an aside, I live in a development with an HOA so I don\\'t put any window AC units in front of the house.I keep the bedroom cold; below 70 degrees (in the winter, I don\\'t heat the bedroom). But downstairs I prefer the temperature much warmer (75-78 degrees) and if the outdoor humidity is low I won\\'t run the window AC at all or run the A/C until the humidity drops.I have three (3) window A/C units that are virtually identical to each other except that there are minor differences to the control panel and louvers but they all use the almost identical remote control units.  They weigh the same, cost the same, have the same internal parts and positioning of the parts. I\\'m guessing that they\\'re all made by the same manufacturer under different names.NOISE:I run the Hanover A/C in the bedroom at the high fan speed. The A/C noise has a pleasant smooth sound like a white noise generator.  My window Frididaire AC units make horrible irritating sounds -- the noise from the Frididaire grates on my nerves and I don\\'t stay in the room while the Frididaire AC is running.I have another Hanover-like AC downstairs.  With the fan at low speed, the noise is minimal which doesn\\'t interfere with conversations.  I don\\'t have to leave the room or turn the AC off when using a phone.Running the A/C at low fan speed will still allow you to hear the TV.LOUVERS:The Hanover louvers can be only be angled left or right.WATER ACCUMULATION:If you live in a humid climate, pay attention to the following.The problem with all of the window AC units is that water and crud (small leaves, seeds, bugs) accumulate on the inside bottom of the AC.  If you live in a humid climate, the fan that is supposed to remove the water by spraying it out through the side grates makes a sloshing sound which drives me nuts.  I always think that there\\'s a water leak in the house or the toilet is running.The water and debris create an ugly mess on the bottom.  At the end of the season when I remove the ACs for winter, I take the AC outdoors and use a hose and run water at high pressure to wash out the junk.Since there\\'s always water on the bottom of the AC, the bottom fins of the radiator is always wet.  The bottom fins and other metal parts will start rusting after a season or two.All the window ACs have a lot of water droplets on the louvers which blows water (with the gunk on the bottom of the AC) back into the room.  I have this problem with all small window AC units. This problem is not unique to this Hanover.I finally came up with a solution that solves all of the water problems.  Since the bottom of these units (Hanover and their clones) are plastic, if you shine a very bright flashlight with a tight beams on the bottom of the AC, you can find areas where water has accumulated and there are no internal parts.  What I did was after locating several safe locations (no internal parts), I marked those spots with a magic marker. Then using a drill, I cut several large holes through the plastic bottom.  The bottom is now totally dry -- the radiator and surrounding area is no longer sitting in water for months on end. If the holes are large enough, seeds, leaves, dust and bugs will be washed away when it rains.NOTE: If the water dripping out of the bottom of the AC will fall onto an area you don\\'t want to get wet (like a deck), then DON\\'T drill any holes.  Even with the bedroom door always closed, the AC removes several gallons of water each day.  A smaller Forstner (example:Steelex D3655 Forstner Bit Set in Case, 7-Piece) bit won\\'t grab and pull up like common metal drill bits.  Work slowly and concentrate on what you\\'re doing and all will go well.SIZE:The extenders will fit a 36\" wide window.  With the extenders fully pushed in, the A/C will fit a window as narrow as 22.5\" or 16\" with the extenders removed.WEIGHT:The AC weighs about 40 pounds.  I\\'m pretty small and I can easily insert and remove the AC from the window by myself.BOXING:Unlike previous A/C units that I had shipped from Amazon, this A/C is double boxed.  That is, the manufacturers box is now enclosed within a sturdy outer box so the chances of receiving a damaged unit due to rough handling is greatly reduced.VERDICT:I\\'m glad that I bought this and would buy it again.  The price and weight is reasonable, the noise isn\\'t irritating, the Hanover has real buttons on the control panel which I really like and outputs very cold air.  I save several hundred dollars each month by running window ACs and I have to run the bedroom AC for over 6 months each year.',\n",

We have a 1 year old and we know from past experience how dry hotel rooms can be and we have seen the benefits of having one and the issues small kids tend to have in dry environments without one.  In the past we have helped bring a full size humidifier with us this time we were traveling without the benefit of additional family members.  This small unit worked great.  it was exactly what we were looking for and worked flawlessly the entire trip.  Aside from the travel days between cities, this little guy was running continuously the whole time in each and every hotel we stayed at.Things I liked:+ fast mist+ small size+ easy to use+ easy to clean+ no small crevices to hide water (extremely useful if you will be moving around a lot)+ automatically shuts off when water level gets low (LED changes to red to warn you)+ runs without refilling for 6-8 hours on high*  (as long as you're willing to ignore the manufacturer's warnings against using larger bottles)+ fold out stabilizer legs to improve stabilityThings I didn't like too much:- blue operation LED is VERY bright (for my taste, my wife didn't mind too much)- blower remains on if you run out of water even when the humidifier stops running- exhaust port did fall shut several times.  didn't stop operation just didn't allow much mist to escapeSome things I learned:* be sure to position the exhaust port near the edge of a tabletop or the falling mist can condense on the table and create a puddle that can seep under the unit* I used the 1liter SMARTWATER bottle and it worked great.  no instability issues maybe because the profile of the bottle is slimmer.* never had a problem with the bottle base, it was easy to install and reuse, and never leaked* out of the box, setup, plug in, supply water, producing mist in 2 minutes ( hist is actually almost instantaneous when you turn it onn with water available.I really liked this humidifier and hope it continues to hold up for future trips.  I would highly recommend to other that travel with kids!UPDATE: 02/2014Well, the little guy finally broke down.  In an extended trip this past holiday season we used the humidifier in the hotels and aboard a cruise ship.  About 2 weeks into the trip I noticed that the midday level was dropping.  We tried to clean the unit with shine vinegar and LOTS of deposits came off the inside (I blame the water on board the cruise ship).  Additionally I learned not to use the new thin walked bottles.  I tried one in Rome and instead of allowing the water to fall into the reservoir, the vacuum collapsed the bottle and then overflowed the reservoir and leaked all over the table and into the blower vent. I don't know if either or both of these things contributed to the units failure but I still would recommend this unit.  The The portability, price, and function is still a great unit.  I will be replacing it before my next trip.\",\n",

       " 'B009L49CLY': {'Best review': 'I needed a relatively budget bed for a home I don\\'t plan on living in for long, and settled on this one. Relatively simple to put together, though you do need a drill. I can\\'t imagine putting this thing together without one. Otherwise, it comes with a screw driver and allen wrench.I suppose I could have simply bought a cheap metal frame, but while I didn\\'t want something expensive that I\\'d have to unload in a few months, I did want something with a little more presence than a barebones metal frame. This fits the bill fairly well.Some things that may not be immediately obvious when considering this bed:* The slats are basically particle board. Wild sex is probably not a great idea on this bed. I\\'m actually mildly concerned about this aspect of the bed, and I guess time will tell if it actually holds up (I\\'ve never used a bed with particle board slats before-usually metal slats on previous beds I\\'ve owned, but they\\'ve admittedly been considerably more expensive).* The black frame is not particle board and is made of solid wood. Not sure what type of wood.* The lip the slats rest on is very soft (pine?) and not very confidence boosting either, and not particularly straight. Not a problem really, just be methodical in straightening them as you screw them to the frame. Don\\'t stress over there being no visible mark on the frame to line the lips at either. You can eyeball it, as they don\\'t need to be perfectly aligned with each other (there\\'s wiggle room on the placement of the slats).* There\\'s a decent sized gap between the mattress, and any wall you might have this bed up against. Just keep that in mind if you were expecting to use a wall as a pseudo headboard. I\\'m using a 10\" Full sized Memory Foam Mattress and it fits perfectly in the space it\\'s supposed to, so not seeing the issue others have with the frame being bigger than the mattress, but the space I talk about is due to the thickness of the frame itself, combined with the legs being on the outside head/foot of the bed, rather than on the side of the frame (left/right), which adds another inch and half plus the thickness of the frame to the separation between your wall and your mattress.* The instructions aren\\'t great, but if you have any experience putting furniture together, that probably isn\\'t a surprise. I honestly can\\'t recall ever having great instructions come with furniture, so it\\'s hard to knock this bed for that. Construction is fairly straight forward regardless. The lips are really the only part that you could conceivably screw up, so take care with those.Had it shipped over the Pacific for $12.99 with overnight shipping as a Prime member. Considering the weight of the box (and the fact that I ordered a mattress through Amazon as well), I suspect this was an oversight on someone\\'s part, as I can only imagine what the shipping ended up costing them (nearly every bed I\\'ve seen on Amazon says it can\\'t be shipped here, heh). So, that was pretty amazing in my quest to find a budget bed for my temporary stay here.Main reason for the 3 stars is my lack of any real confidence in the particle board slats, even if the bed is functioning just fine at the moment.',\n",

       " 'B002ZDJYC0': {'Best review': 'Update, 2/8/14:I am changing my rating to one star. I originally gave it 5 stars. Last summer, after having owned two of these for less than 2 years, we noticed they both constantly went into \"defrost\" mode, with the P1 display and runnning at turbo speed, wasting electricity. They would do this even when they had just been plugged-in or shortly after they had been plugged-in. Also, we noticed that the humidity reading seemed to be really off. It would register low humidity, even when we placed it directly in front of a damp spot. The units were not pulling much moisture from the air, as evidenced by the low water level in the bucket, even after running for hours.This week, we attempted to use both of them because we got a lot of rain and a bit of water in our basement. NEITHER unit is working. After 15 hours of running, each of them had 1/2\" to 3/4\" of water in the bucket. That was it. Meanwhile, they would run for a while and then P1 would show on the display and it would be in \"defrost\" mode, supposedly.We did NOT use these units every day, so we didn\\'t wear them out. We only used them when we got some water in the basement or on very humid summer days. So they were used maybe 20-30 days per year. When not in use, they were up on cement blocks with a plastic bag over them to keep dust out. And now they are dead and I own two expensive bricks. Of course, the warranty period is over.Yet another example of cheap Chinese junk being imported into this country, being sold -- at $200 a pop -- and then turning into garbage. Great.My original enthusiastic review is below. You can ignore any praise I gave the units, but there may be other information in the review that you will find helpful. I am off to buy another dehumidifier, but NOT a Sunpentown unit!*****************************************Wow, Amazon continues to make me a happy customer. Our basement flooded, due to 8 inches of rain that fell in a short period of time. After getting all the water off the floor, the basement was still extremely damp and humid. We already had one dehumidifier, an old Kenmore that has served us well. But that was not going to cut it for a full, wet basement. Before I even finished Shop-vaccing, I got online, read the reviews on Amazon, picked the Sunpentown based on the reviews and picked overnight shipping (cheap, because I have Amazon Prime). I knew I would have no time to get to a store, and that seemed like the best option.The unit arrived the next afternoon. It is a bit heavy (50 pounds), so I dragged it in the house, unboxed it upstairs and carried it down to the basement. Put it in the part of the basement opposite the older dehumidifier, turned it on \"Turbo\" and away it went. Wow, that\\'s all I have to say. The unit can really draw moisture out of the air amazingly fast. I emptied the (full) bucket 3 times in the first 24 hours! In just a couple of hours, the basement was noticeably less humid.It\\'s now been a full 48 hours, and the unit is still drawing a lot of moisture from the air. According to its display, it has lowered the humidity from 60% to 40%. Best of all, my basement floor is about 90% dry. I don\\'t know about the future, but as of right now, I am totally impressed.PROS:Efficient at removing moisture.Relatively quieter than our ancient dehumidifier. On \"Turbo\", it sounds like a loud fan.Hey, you can dry some laundry by hanging it above the exhaust, which is on top of the unit!Convenient red ball float lets you quickly see how full the unit is.Nice neutral color.Wheels/castors let you roll it wherever you need it.CONS:Box is heavy to get into the house.Bucket is quite heavy when it is full.A little water always spills when removing the bucket. (Not a problem if you use the continuous drain feature.)The exhaust puts out quite a bit of heat and has warmed the basement. That would be bad if you were using it in a living space during the summer time.',\n",

It really is and feels very nice and comforting.2) Pillow has no virtually odors out of the box. The box is nice, as comes very protected and not in a plastic bag.3) Not as expensive compared to others seen. There is a Hydrolux pillow here that is like 50-bucks+ and this one has SAME cooling surface made by Hydrolux (also sold on Amazon), and it is considerably cheaper! LOLCons:1) Pillow is VERY thin, definitely NOT 4\" thick as shown here. It is more like 2\" - 3\" tops. This may pose a problem for proper neck support and it seems now that I have to add a 2nd thin pillow below it (keeping the green surface towards my head) because I am a side sleeper and this is WAY to thin.2) It is a bit expensive for me to have to add 2nd pillow below it to have decent support/height, so that is a con.3) Cooling surface does not stay cool all night, of course. But it helps a bit to help fall asleep in 20-30mins before it warms up to your normal body temp.4) Not washable, so Lysol is as good cleaning as you can give it. :-/Thoughts so far (to be updated):This is not as expensive as some other pillows and it is extremely soft, which is nice. The only pillow system I know that will stay cool all night is SelectComfort with the material that runs either cool or hot air through pillows and mattress, but these cost like $ 3 Grand, so this is as good as it gets in its price range.Will update more later this week after a few more nights of sleep. :)3 WEEK UPDATE OF PILLOW NIGHTLY USE:After 3 weeks using the pillow, I had no choice but to buy a cheapie & thin 5-buck pillow at local store to place under this pillow. I have broad shoulders and I am a side-sleeping male, so the lack of thickness of this pillow and the fact that it is very soft (head sinks into it) formed me to do this. That is disappointing of such an expensive pillow (I am used to $15 pillows max).As for the cooling features, as stated before, it is cool for no more then 10-20minutes. Maybe I am just now used to it, but the cooling gel area seems much less effective as of late.All in all, it is a nice pillow if you sleep on your back. It is very soft and comfortable, but cannot be used by side sleepers, unless you are a 90lbs female. Males should take note and have a small pillow to place under it and test, as might have problems with neck and lower back pain if the two-pillow set-up is either too high and will have shoulder pain if 2-pillow set-up is not used.I reduced star rating from 3  --> 2 due to the fact that it is not a standalone product and price-usefulness has hurt its rating.',\n",

I have used the fan on level I & II.  In this small space, I have no need to go to level III (and barely a need to use level II).  It puts out lots of air, and I feel the noise level is \"average\" for a fan.  A fan is going to make some noise if its putting out some air.  I would equate it to \"white noise\" in offices.

Information which was absent from the description on the product page.First - this bag comes in the standard blue package with the large yellow \"S\" on the front, while also stating it is the \"allergen\" type for canister cleaners.  If that\\'s the specific picture you are looking for, this is the correct bag.  Unfortunately, the picture on the product page did not indicate this so I just took a chance and jumped into the pool.  Fortunately, it was what I wanted.Second - there are 3 bags in each package.  I looked everywhere on the product page and it NEVER told me how many bags I would be getting.  This is the standard number contained in this package, but it would have really been nice to have been told that along with the product description.So, I got exactly the vacuum cleaner bag I was looking for, with the exact quantity of bags I had hoped for.  It would have been nice to get that information from the supplier!*****EDIT*****March 3, 2010  I see that this supplier has posted the picture of the container you will receive when you order this bag.  I would like to say thank you very much to them for seeing the need to make consumers aware of exactly which product they are ordering.  Well done!*****EDIT*****April 25, 2010  Now the supplier has taken down the wonderful example of the container you will receive and put the totally non-helpful picture back in it\\'s place.  I give up.*****EDIT*****January 22, 2013  I bought these bags again for the umpteenth time and received them today.  The packaging is different (no blue bag, no large yellow \"S\"; now white, black & red bag with red circle and white \"S\") and there is a small difference in the design of the bag.  Now there is a tab stuck onto the cardboard intake mounting which unfolds -- probably to help remove the full bag from the vacuum.  I don\\'t see much reason for this new addition but somebody evidently thought it was a good idea.  Also, the area around where the debris enters the bag has been reinforced and the center hole has already been punched. Now made in China instead of the USA.',\n",

No more tiny little basket under the kitchen sink ;-). While out shopping for one, I had every intention of buying a Simplehuman can - had one before and I like the look, like the stainless steel coolness - but wanted one with the step-on-the-lever-and-open-the-lid variety. Yep, that's what I really wanted because I love being able to open the lid hands-free, just using my feet.Unfortunately (or fortunately?) I took my daughter with me and she spotted this sensor can. I'll admit, I had fun playing with the store model (she did too, we didn't want to leave) and we took turns waving our hands over it and watching it open & close. Worked like a charm! And that's when I fell in love. But just like any new relationship, there were bumps ahead.I experienced the darn!-I-just-walked-by-you-and-you-opened phase (so I moved it) and the I-just-don't-feel-like-working-on-the-relationship phase in which I had to manually close the darn lid. Then came the I-should-have-bought-the-step-kind thoughts...I had to return this one. But because my daughter chose this sensor type and hey, why not give it another try? - I got another sensor can. This one worked much better! I still have the occasional what's-wrong-with-you-today! moments, but this trash can has trained me to hover my hand over the lid on every trash can -- then comes the moment of clarity that I'm not in my kitchen and this isn't my beloved can :-)So, most of the time it works, sometimes it doesn't (3 months later and I need new batteries), but I found I really like the sensor and worth the 6 C batteries and the occasional argh!-just-close-already! moments.\",\n",

       " 'B002EB026K': {'Best review': 'I just used these for the first time, and they are wonderful! The pillow sham had a faint odor, but I am hypersensitive - hubby didn\\'t notice anything. The feel is wonderful. It\\'s almost like satin, but not nearly as slippery. One thing that I didn\\'t realize (and I don\\'t mind it, but others may not want it) is that only one side is the striped fabric. The other is a smooth satiny finish. This gives you a choice, but I expected both the top and bottom to be the same fabric. It\\'s quite nice either way, but some people are pickier.Anyway, I got the black, queen sized sets. (I buy 2 for my king-sized bed, because my hubby and I are both very \"active\" sleepers, and like to hog the blanket.) The color is really nice, deep, dark black. The stripes are very tasteful - more of an illusion than a color difference. The quality is very good with no fraying inside the cover, and the sham covers were big enough to fit my king-size down pillows, although they are very puffy. I am sure that they would be great with a standard pillow.These are definitely a great value for the price. They may not be Egyptian Cotton 600TC premium linens, but at 1/10th the price, they are a steal!EDIT: I just ditched these after less than a year.  I am leaving the 5-star rating though, because in many ways they are 5-star worthy. Here\\'s the thing. If you use your duvet like a bedspread, then this is a wonderful product. If, however, you use your duvet like a sheet/blanket combo (like Europeans do), then this may not be the best choice.  We found that the satin fabric, while soft and wonderful at the beginning, had a tendency to \"catch\" on dry skin. especially our feet. This eventually caused pulling and pilling, and that became really uncomfortable. When I tried a clothes shave it got even worse.So, I would say, if you have dry skin and you plan to use the duvet against your skin, this may not be the best solution. It\\'s a shame, because they still LOOKED really nice, as I put them in the trash! If you want them as a regular bedspread, with a top sheet, or for a guest room, then get these for sure!',\n",

It looks cheap, but from what I've seen of the price, that's not the case and the price seems to keep going up. After seeing the assembled product, I think I'd be disappointed if I paid what they're asking.I also don't think it will last long based on what I'm using it for. I have it where my kids do their crafts and it stores papers, glue, glue sticks, pens, pencils and scissors. My main concern is that the sides and top are white cardboard. How can one possible keep that clean? I'm not even going to try. From the get-go, I assumed it would get smudged with various things. That way I won't be disappointed when it's filthy after a few months around my kids and their crafts. My first thought however, when assembling this product, was would happen if the cardboard got wet? It seems like it would take just one sweating glass set on there to make the top swell and then fall apart. It hasn't happened with ours yet, but I fully expect it to at some point.There are some positive aspects to these cubes. Although the instructions are not overly specific (like which direction certain things go), they are easy to follow and most pieces snap into place. Once assembled, the unit seems quite sturdy, unlike a plastic storage drawer set I have (made by Rubbermaid). The magnetic closure on the door works well, keeping the door closed, yet it's easy to open. The plastic door is also sturdy as evidenced when a chair leg was pressing into the cabinet, bending the door, but not breaking it.It depends what you're looking for - it's uses and how pristine you want it to look in the long term.

I say &#34;for now&#34; because from most reviews I've read, the problems come after continued use. In my own opinion, the bed is sturdy, comfy to sleep on, & free of those awful squeaky noises that often accompany beds like these. It sits an appropriate height above the floor for plenty of under bed storage. The slats seem to be a good means of support & the metal looks to be of good quality. A few tips & notes if you're looking to buy:1) I noticed there are no extras of anything included with this bed. Keep up carefully with all materials, because if you lose any of it, you're up the creek until the company can send you replacements.2) Assembly time by yourself is going to range from 1 to 2 hours. Im a 23 year old female with plenty of experience in diy projects, but I have a bad back. This assembly is HARD on the back & neck, regardless of whether it's done sitting or standing. If you have arthritis or any bone disorder, I suggest getting help to speed up the process & avoid harming yourself.3) Another thing that slowed me down is I did not have any hex bits for my power drill. If you can, pick one up at the local Walmart. For only a few bucks, it would definitely speed things up.4) My weigh in on the controversy over whether or not you need a hammer or mallet, yes. You do. While using your hands to push the end caps on the slats into the frame is possible, it tends to bend the cap teeth, making it take longer to lock in. With the single tap of a mallet or *light* tap of a hammer, they go in much smoother.5) As for the reviewers saying their slats broke immediately, I find that ridiculous. One reviewer even said it was her child that broke the slats just by lying on it. All I can say is, Im 190 lbs. & I've slept on it two nights. No cracks. No breaks.....Take that how you will....6) Just an opinion. This is not a &#34;forever&#34; bed. Obviously, $95 for a queen bed is pretty cheap. It's basically just metal stilts under a thin metal frame with birch slats as a box spring. This isn't some $300-500 wooden bed that's extremely solid & will last. I bought this bed solely because it does not have foot or headboards & that really opens up my small bedroom. My point is, it'll definitely do until I can afford to move out of my parent's home & into my own home with a larger bedroom that can accommodate a larger bed.

And that's where the little bit of trouble with these mats comes in. If you never had to wash them, they would be a superb addition to any bathroom floor. But of course washing is especially critical in the bathroom, and that's when the backing turns into tiny white particles all over the mats and anything else in the load with them. So not only do I have little speckles all over my laundry, but although the mats still look good so far, I imagine that the backing won't last too long if it keeps getting washed away. So as much as I'd like to, I cannot recommend these mats with much enthusiasm.Update: I'm adding a star, because over time the laundering problem faded, and the mats are still holding up just fine after well over two years. If you have the patience to wait out the white speckle period, you may be very happy with them. I am.\",\n",

They hold enough to clean a 10 X 12 bedroom that is lightly soiled.The suction is not as strong as a machine with a larger motor, but it is strong enough to pick up 90% of the cleaning water if you go back and forth over the saturated area repeatedly until you NO LONGER SEE WATER BEING DRAWN INTO THE RECOVERY TANK.

Haven't had it for very long, so I can't comment as to its durability over time. The reason I did not give it five stars is that the lanyard is not replaceable; it is attached directly to the unit from the inside. If it was attached with clips, then I could replace it with perhaps a slightly wider strap that would be more comfortable on my neck. Also, if the one provided were to break somehow, there is no way to replace it. Other than that, I expect to get a lot of relief from this little fan!UPDATE 9/15/2012: I've been using the fan for a couple of months now and still loving it. In fact, I just ordered a second one! With two, I can keep one in my purse and one out at home. With only one, I'm always afraid that if I remove it from my purse while at home, I'll forget to put it back and then be without it when I'm away from home. It really does provide wonderful relief for hot flashes. Unless you've experienced them, you have no idea how important that is!

Remove the filter and we believe it is best to take the filter outside, preferably to the garage or a dumpster, so that you do not spread all the dust indoors. First, tap the filter gently on the side of the garbage can so that most of the dust falls in. Rinse outside surface of filter with running water. Make sure to air-dry the filter thoroughly and completely before you replace it in the vacuum cleaner.  We suggest 24-48 hours.

It created even more room than I expected it would!My girlfriend saw a curvy shower curtain rod in a hotel and wanted one for our bathroom.  She said it would make a huge difference.  We have a pretty small shower stall in a small apartment bathroom.  I was skeptical.She did everything -- took the old rod down and installed this new one.  She used the old holes in the drywall as guides, so she didn't have to do much measuring.  It was really easy for her -- all she needed was a screwdriver and a drill.  It comes with everything else you need (drywall anchors etc).  I'm now a believer -- it's AMAZING how much extra room we have now!  I'm 6' tall with broad shoulders and have always felt cramped in our shower.  But now it's like we have a whole new shower!A great way to spend money since it impacts a part of our daily lives in a hugely positive way.A few specific notes:1.  About drill bit sizes:  the instructions say you need a 9/32&#34; (7mm) bit to install the drywall anchors.  We only have up to 1/4&#34;, so my girlfriend used that and just &#34;wiggled&#34; the bit around.  Worked great.  If you want direct stud installation, the instructions say you need a 5/32&#34; (4mm) bit.  Wood is different than drywall, of course, so maybe you actually need that size in this case.2.  Being fairly tall, I thought this rod might bother me in the bathroom -- since it curves away from the shower stall it's now in the &#34;open space&#34; of the bathroom, above the toilet.  She installed it high enough that it's not an issue, however, and after a few days I stopped noticing that anything was different.  Our shower curtain tucks away in the corner of the tub just like it did before, so basically nothing has changed in the convenience department.\",\n",

After a lot of hedging with Amazon's many choices, I decided on this one by Serta partly based on reviews, and partly because Serta leads the mattress field with their gel coolness technology.  On arrival the pillow was wrapped in clear plastic printed with the bold black Serta label, there was a Serta booklet enclosed, then 2 other pamphlets saying congratulations on your Sleep Innovations gel-infused memory foam pillow purchase, and warranty info from Sleep Innovations.  SAY WHAT?  I initially thought that a Sleep Innovations pillow was mistakenly sent in a Serta bag but no, the Serta booklet explained all - inside it says:&#34;Serta by Sleep Innovations - The Ultimate in Memory Foam Innovation.  Serta, one of the world's most recognized and trusted brand names, has partnered with Sleep Innovations to bring you a complete range of premium memory foam products...&#34;  Thereafter are photos of three different memory foam pillows including this gel reversible one, and two mattress toppers.  It seems this line is made exclusively for Amazon, which is a good thing as you're getting a better quality pillow than some of the prior SI gel pillows, which could be harder & more odorous (see reviews from BJ's).  What I received is a good quality, comfy, ventilated with air holes memory foam pillow of medium firmness, cushy yet supportive, with a firmer gel side that initially was pretty hard but again, one of the pamphlets explained why:&#34;when exposed to colder climates (it is winter in NY & courier left pillow outdoors) your pillow will become firmer, allow your pillow 24-48 hrs to renew its feel once placed in room temperature.&#34;  Also, this pillow had the barest trace of memory foam smell, which went away the next day after removing cover (a nice soft quilted 100% cotton cover w/ Serta label sewn on side).  I have to say, for this reasonable price, I'm happy with my new gel foam pillow and definitely notice a cooler sleep experience, no waking up with a sweaty neck.  Once again, Serta proves its reliability.\",\n",

Ultraviolet light is the best odor absorber to date; however being LEDs\\' and the fact that a little odor remains tells me the LEDs\\' don\\'t put out true UV light, or are simply not powerful enough.Pros:Super quietEasy to clean, nearly fool proofDoesn\\'t get dirty too quicklyIt will dry the \"Truman cell\" ionizer prior to energizing it, so it doesn\\'t cause permanent damage.Nightlight that has 3 brightness levels (off, low, high)Remote controlCons:Odor absorbency could be better, but is adequate.I will update further if anything changes.',\n",

Let me give you some background information regarding my situation and use for this little machine...I have 5 cats in a three-story townhome and need to vacuum my place a couple of times a week. Once a month, I have a cleaning lady who does a more thorough cleaning (and uses the regular vacuum), but I still need to do some vacuuming a couple of times a week because the carpet ends up covered with cat hair, dust, etc.But I also work full-time and have about 2 1/2 hours of commute every day, so I really don't feel like spending the time vacuuming when I am home. That's why I bought this toy.CONS- To be honest, you should always have it running while you can keep an eye on it. The manual says it will learn the location and you only need to supervise it the first couple of times you use it, and it may very be that I will use it on different floors with different layouts alternatively so it doesn't get to learn the floor plan, but it has a tendency to get stuck on the same spots, so it's good to at least keep an ear on it while it works so you can come and rescue the little beast when it gets stuck.- Cleaning the equipment is a bit of a pain. It's easy to empty it, but cleaning the brushes is the part I am not so thrilled about...- Also, the cleaning isn't as thorough as what you get with a full-sized, regular vacuum cleaner.PROS- Even if you need to keep an eye (or ear) on it, you can let it run around while you are doing other things that you need to do yourself, like the dishes, watching TV, playing cards, working on your bills, etc.- It beats the heck out of having to pull the heavy and awkward vacuum cleaner out of the closet, drag it up and down the stairs and doing the vacuuming yourself!All things considered, it was a great investiment! I know it's $150, but I would be paying the cleaning lady more than that extra per month if I had her coming over every week, as I had at my other place because the mess of hairs just used to get out of control.Good luck!  :)\",\n",

In fact, after I placed the order I almost canceled it scared I might be the guinea pig for the item so to speak. I received them and was very impressed with how soft they were. I washed them immediately with detergent and fabric softener, and they very super soft. They get a 5 for softness. They also get a 5 for color, it was the right match. It is a sage that is not too light or too dark. They do lose a point though in quality. Instead of having an overlay of fabric at the end of the pillow, they have very small holes. I liked that because you will not feel it as much as standard pillow cases. However, they do not line up. I took a picture and added it to the photo gallery, please observe.For the price you really can't go wrong though. I am one that buys six pillows for my bed or needs extra cases for the guest room and it seems pillow cases alone can cost as much as a sheet set. I should know because the night I bought these I looked at 5 other online retailers and the lowest was 3 times the price, with shipping. Again, you can't go wrong with Amazon.Update February 16, 2011, I had this at 4 stars but am now giving it 3. I cannot believe how much hair gets stuck to these pillow cases. I do not have this issue with other pillows cases. I have to lint roll each one three times in the morning. The color is still great and the sage is soft. I see another reviewer bought 3 colors and it seems only the blue worked out, which is sad to read.

All of today's dustbusters have non-pleated filters which completely clog in a minute of two if dust is sucked up. Our old CHV9600's filter lasts so long, my wife didn't even realize it ever needed to be cleaned. We would go months before I'd clean it.Unfortunately, Black and Decker are now making much worse dustbusters with gimicks. No other dustbuster has a replaceable battery. Planned replacement cycle. In a few years you're forced to buy an inferior product from them again. Surprisingly, the competition hasn't made anything better either.This dustbuster, the SPV1800 does have a pleated filter, the VF20. Its pretty good, but not as good as the VF100 from the CHV9600. Still it can suck up lots of dust before it needs to be cleaned.This dustbuster overall seems very similar to the dustbuster we had in the early 2000's before our CHV9600.Pros: Its the only dustbuster with a pleated filter that can suck up a good bit of dust before clogging up.It has good suction, especially when the filter is clean. Some other current models have better suction, but only when very clean. Realistically, this one works much better.I love that it has a replaceable battery. Theoretically, the vac should last forever. Just replace the battery and filter. We've never had a dustbuster fail other than battery wearing out.Cons: Its expensive. Have to remove the battery to charge it up. No attachments. Our CHV9600 had crevice tool and brush which sorta work on this one. A big drawback is that you can't see in the compartment. Can't tell how full it is and can't tell what you've sucked up.We're also trying a FHV1200 portable vac which also has a pleated filter, but typical B&D;, the battery is not replaceable.

I purchased a carpet spot cleaner and reviews recommended putting white vinegar into a spray bottle to spray pet stains with first before using the cleaner to make the carpet software.  So I picked this up as it was highly reviewed.I left the bottle on the bathroom sink's counter overnight a couple of days ago.  The next day there was some vinegar on the counter.  Unsure if my son had spilled some or if it was leaking, I put a cloth under it and left it in the sink for another day.  The next day it was worse, and now I could actually see that the vinegar was leaking from a small hole in the seal along the bottom.  Emptied the vinegar and tossed the spray bottle out.Not really worth going through the trouble of returning it, and I assume that this problem isn't common with the company but I can only review the product and experience I personally have had.

I opened up the packaged and was overwhelmed by a very strong chemical smell, kind of like the smell of diesel or oil.  It is not a light scent, it was thick.  I washed them and it was still there, so I washed them again with baking soda and an extra rinse and it was faint but still there. They were also were thinner than I was expecting from the photo. I dried them and was going to put them in the box for return because of those two things (smell, thin)...but we needed sheets for the night because my others were still dirty and these were washed.  So I put them on the bed and we tried them out and doing that has changed my mind about returning them...they are so completely soft and warm.  My husband got in and said wow several times and then his exact words were \"this is like sleeping on a big pillowy cloud.\"  I normally wake up in the night freezing cold but these sheets kept me warm all night and they are so comfy and soft that I kept running my feet over them.  Neither of us wanted to get out of bed this morning because we were so cozy in the sheets.- Strong smell that you\\'ll have to get out before using- VERY soft and warm, feel great against your skin- I ordered sage, it is not the same color as in the picture it is a couple shades darker- Fits easily over the mattress with room to spare and I didn\\'t have to use my sheet clips that I normally do- Machine wash cold gentle cycle, tumble dry low- Fabric: 100% Microfiber Polyester- No problems with pilling or lint leftover in the washer- Made in China*UPDATE* I liked these so much I ordered another set, only in cocoa.  These came today and were so cheaply made that I had to return them. They also have switched the insert that comes in them to say Cozy Nightzzz instead of Elite Home. Everything else the same on the label except that. Stitching was torn or hanging loose, runs in them.  Extremely thin material and cheap.

After weeks of comparing, pricing, shopping online, I settled on this one (the one I originally started with)!Pros- 10 inch thick is just about right.  Not so thin that you can feel the slats of the futon, but not so thick it doesn't fold up into a sitting position on the futon- Color is about as advertised- Came vacuumed packed so it was easy enough for me to get upstairs to the guest room without any assistance- Firm enough so you are comfortable, but not so firm that it feels like you are sleeping on a slab of concrete.- Definitely thicker and more comfortable than a pull out sofa with a flimsy mattress.Cons- I definitely need to get a removable cover for it.  I have cats who love to lay all over it - so having something I can take off and wash would be a big plus!- There is a slight odor to it when you open it - but nothing so horrible it has to be sent back or I need to complain about it.  It is airing out nicely.- Not really a con, but it does take a few days to fluff up.\",\n",

So soft, in fact, that I don't doubt it would not hold in the heat very well without a blanket on top, although why you would not put a blanket over it is beyond me. It is very light, so it reduces the weight of the covers. This is good for people, like me, who have sensitive limbs and/or nerve damage and cannot tolerate a lot of blanket weight. But with your comforter on top of it, it holds in the heat very well. It gets very warm, and likewise reduces the temperature quickly when you turn the heat down. I was afraid I'd feel the cords because the material is so thin, but I don't feel them at all through my sheet. The controllers are nice and have long cords; longer than the Sunbeam blanket we just took off our bed. Overall, it is a much better electric blanket than our old Sunbeam. We'll just have to see how it lasts.UPDATE 12/30/12:  We have had this blanket 10 months now and are using it during our second winter with it. The only negative thing I can say is the material is a bit stretchy and somewhat difficult to pull up over my shoulders during the night. It seems to work its way down the bed towards the foot while we sleep and I have to pull it up the bed every morning when I make it. This is our 3rd electric blanket and the first to do this. I'm not sure why it happens. It's not long enough to tuck in at the end on our queen-size bed with a thick mattress, so we just had the corners tucked to keep it from moving up too far during the night. That appeared to have the opposite reaction and pulls it down every night while we sleep. We took the corners out today and we're just going to see what happens. I'd rather have it over my shoulders and and get pulled up every night and just move it down in the morning. However, we still love it. It heats quickly, and is so soft to the touch. It was still a wonderful buy.\",\n",

It is NOT a very high BTU heater that can alone heat up a large room or floor.  It is designed for supplemental heat.  We use it to successfully supplement our home gas heater system overnight, so that we can turn down the main house thermostat to about 62-64 degrees when we're asleep, and thus save money and energy on our gas bill while maintaining a higher temperature in our bedroom only.  It has 3 convenient power settings, and a working thermostat, and we find that even in low power position, enough heat is given off such that we can keep our 15' by 22' bedroom warm enough at night, even though our home's thermostat is down at around 62 or 64 degrees, instead of our normal 68 degrees during the day, when we obviously use other rooms in the house.  We never use high power, and find that low and medium power gives off ample heat for our purposes.  In addition, the thermostat works perfectly such that once adequate temperature has been achieved, it will turn off power temporarily for minutes at a time, thus saving energy, while the already heated oil within this radiator continues to give off heat!  Very efficient indeed.  Heaters like this one are an effective way to help save $$$ on your total energy bill during those cold winter nights.  Highly recommended.\",\n",
       "  'description': \"Keep warm during the cool months while conserving energy with the SafeHeat Electric Oil Radiator from industry leader, DeLonghi. The 1500-watt radiator utilizes a third less wattage than comparable models, saving precious energy and trimming dollars off the energy bill. Solo, the radiator best serves 12-by-14-foot rooms and smaller during the frigid months of winter. It also proves itself handy as a cost-effective alternative to a central heating system during the fall and spring, when some heating is necessitated in the early and late hours of the day. The radiator also finds use in conjunction with a central heat system, creating a cozier atmosphere in a room teeming with people.Double-insulated metal construction makes up the radiator. With three power settings for varying needs, the radiator runs low at 600 watts, medium at 900 watts, and high at 1500 watts. The radiator emits heat through patented thermal slots to minimize potential burns, ensuring that the hot elements are fairly inaccessible deep within the slots. Activation of the antifreeze setting will trigger the radiator when the indoor temperature hits 44 degrees F or below. A thermostat allows users to track the room's temperature. The lightweight appliance travels on provided snap-on wheels. Upon initial use, the radiator may give off an unpleasant aroma that should cease after two hours use. Some small crackling sounds also can be expected. DeLonghi advises against using the radiator under a power outlet, outdoors, or near flammable liquids. Avoid running the power line under carpets and unplug the appliance when idle for the utmost safety. Thorough guidelines and instructions for the simple assembly process are included. A limited one-year warranty covers this item. The radiator measures 27-2/5 by 15-2/5 by 6-3/5 inches and weighs 30 pounds upon shipping.--Jessica Reuling\",\n",

If you don\\'t want to read further, the overall point is that this product works well for what it is.  I\\'m pleased with the purchase and glad I did not buy one of the other brands.First, it is important to note that stand-alone air conditioners will never be as good as window units.  That is a fact.  However, there is often a need to buy these stand-alone units (such as in my case, where window units are banned in my apartment lease).I live in Detroit, which is not the hottest place is summer, but does get quite hot and humid nonetheless.  Overall, this product does cool off my bedroom, which is actually quite large.  Yes, it does take some time to do so (about an hour at the hottest times), but can run for a good 12 hours straight.  I run it on high, with the fan on high as well (they are separate controls), and my bedroom can get quite cold.There are some downsides, which are true of all these stand-alone units.  First, if you have \"non-standard\" windows (which will apply to most buyers), the directions tell you to cut the pvc window cover to fit.  That\\'s great if you know someone who has expertise in cutting through pvc.  I do not.  I ended up using styrofoam from the packaging to \"tweak\" the window cover to fit.  It\\'s not a great seal, and even has some spaces, but the unit still cools effectively.  So that\\'s a plus for this product.If you run the unit for 12 hours or more, you will need to empty it.  Water collects at the bottom and the unit will automatically shut itself off.  There is a spout at the very bottom, only about an inch off of the ground.  When you open it, water pours out.  To empty, you will need a cookie sheet.  I have not found anything else, other than a cookie sheet, that is thin enough to sit below the inch-high spout.  And I often have to put the plug back in, empty the sheet, then resume the process two to three times before it is empty.  Sometimes I will even balance the unit on the cookie sheet and tip it over slightly to get all of the water out.  This is a bit annoying, but I suspect it is the same with all stand-alone units.  And on the hottest of days, it\\'s really a small inconvenience for a nicely cooled room.Other than these issues, the unit works well.  It is definitely effective in cooling, (even a large and oddly shaped bedroom like mine).  The controls allow you to personalize the cooling temperature, the cooling output, and the fan.  It was also relatively easy to assemble (I had a few minutes of trouble figuring out the hoses, but I\\'m also a novice) and put in place.  It has wheels, so you can easily move it from room to room (but may have an issue if windows in different rooms are different sizes).  I think it\\'s one of the better stand-alone air conditioners.',\n",

With the old style mattress and box spring, the size would have been fine. The shams on the Queen size are small, also, so it would have been nice to have larger shams, but not a deal breaker. We put some older standard pillows in them, and they look fine. I love the look.

We ordered 3 of these 30 piece sets and just replaced *everything* with these since they use only 3 lids and they all nest.I love everything about them except two things:#1 the lids and containers have areas that collect water in the dishwasher, so when you get them out of the dishwasher they get everything else wet unless you're very careful and then require hand drying.#2 the fact that the lids snap together and can be snapped onto the bottom of the containers themselves is a neat idea, but in reality it means that the lids are designed in such a way that if you fill the containers even close to full the lid will no longer seal closed.  For instance, if you put half an avocado with the seed still in it in one of the smaller shallow containers, the seed sticks up to right at the top of the container...  normally that would be ok, but with these the lid won't close properly because of how it's designed.Other than that, well constructed, stackable, looks nice, very happy with these.\",\n",

       " 'B0000DJ27I': {'Best review': \"I bought this fan a year ago thanks to the great review by dontwannabeageek, who had the same basic criteria I did.I wanted a fan primarily to use when I'm on the elliptical machineSchwinn 430 Elliptical Trainer, and also for use in the living room enabling me to use the A/C less frequently.Pros: It's super quiet, even on high (and I'm pretty sensitive to noise), moves enough air to keep me cool when exercising, it's easy to clean because the grille is removable, AND it's made in America. Yay! The neutral color makes it unobtrusive, and blends in with any decor. It's also light weight, so it's easy to move around, yet very sturdy. It oscillates and tilts up and down. It's exactly what I was looking for and has every feature I wanted.Assembly Tips: The round part that screws down over the fan blades to lock them in is tightened counter-clockwise, which is backward from the usual way. Tighten till just snug, don't over tighten. Also, when attaching the grille, it helps to have a flat head/slot type screwdriver to push the tabs in, and also for removing the grille for cleaning.Note: The year before I had purchased theHoneywell HT800 Super Turbo High Performance Fan, Blackin white, and it was so noisy I couldn't stand it. I wish I had found the Lasko fan then!Bottom Line: I love the fan so much, I bought a second one for the bedroom a few weeks later.P.S. Usage Tip: I also got this remote switchSuper Switch Wireless Remoteso I could set the fan across the room, and be able to turn it on and off from the bed. Not out of laziness, but if halfway through the night you feel cold/hot, you don't have to rouse yourself out of bed, or disturb your partner. It would also be good for someone with mobility problems.UPDATE 7/30/11 I have had these fans for 2 years now, and am just as happy with them now as when I wrote the original review. I have three of them now, one for the bedroom, one for the living room and one for the elliptical/exercising. LOVE! &lt;3\",\n",

My husband recycles everything - dead Christmas lights are stripped for copper wire and much more. All of these bits and pieces go into containers until he has enough to take to our recycling center. He works at a table in our basement family room and I was always moving boxes and containers from the floor and seating areas. This is the perfect solution. We can roll this to his table to work with; it also has room for his art supplies and then it rolls back to a space behind our couch.With an 80 lb. weight limit for the top and 25 lb. for the lower shelves, there is no problem even holding heavier bolt cutters. The unit shelves are smooth and sturdy.He put the unit together by himself in an hour and 30 minutes. It does say you need 2 people, but the only help he needed was to carry it. You need to follow the well written instructions, especially assembling it on a rug so that the smooth surfaces do not get scratched. There are no tools included, but all you need is a hammer, a regular screwdriver and a Philips screwdriver. We also used a drill to use all the caster screws.The only problem came when it was time to attach the 5 casters, one is in the middle. There are 4 holes on each caster unit. There were screws included to use in the 4 holes, but the unit itself only had 2 holes drilled in it. The casters seemed okay with 2 screws, but we drilled our own holes anyway to fit all 4 screws.It is a handsome, simple unit, it rolls well. And the casters do have brakes, which especially for the middle one would be hard to lift the latch up and down when the unit is in use. I would not want to have a TV on top and have this rolling around, so the brakes are useful.\",\n",

Not only does this have the adjustable feature where the other did not but it's even easier and quick to assemble.

The only effect I noticed was that it made the whole plunger harder to clean.  (Its threads hold onto all the dirty stuff much more than the smooth rubber, and took a lot of work to clean off.)  Also, this orange part came off completely, and got accidentally flushed down the toilet.  I think it made the problem a bit worse for a little bit, since it probably had a hard time working its way through the plumbing.

It definitely weighs less than my laptop -- and that's incredible for a vacuum.  Just at 7lbs according to my scale.When the box arrived I thought it had to be a mistake. I knew it was supposed to be light but the UPS guy handed it to me with one hand and was holding out his signature pad with the other. It weighs nothing.Unpacking it was super easy. There are no attachments. This is a floor vacuum and that's it. It would be awesome for professional cleaning services who need power but who have to haul things around. Also would be perfect for someone who is elderly. Anyway, I unpacked it, popped the handle on and it was ready.There is a cloth-like bag inside already and I'm pretty sure you can reuse that a time or two before needing to purchase replacement bags. (The bags are currently cheaper on Amazon than at the Oreck site). The cord is really long so that's a huge bonus. I hate getting halfway across the room and BAM the vacuum shuts off and I've bent the prongs on the plug unknowingly in a cleaning frenzy.The first place I decided to test this was my son's room. I have no idea how he gets so much crap in there and tiny pieces of stuff everywhere. He also must walk through something repeatedly and track it back and forth so that the nap of his carpet by the door is kind of not sticky, but grimy and beaten down -- we have relatively new carpet. This little powerhouse shocked me! The carpet gave up a lot of stuff my old vacuum could never, ever have gotten out. His carpet looks all fluffy and new. I was about to have the carpets professionally cleaned but instead was inspired to just get some vinegar and scrub up a couple of stains he's created and voila! It looks fresh and new.The vacuum lays completely flat so I was able to vacuum up dust bunnies and hair clumps from our dog without having to move the bed or even strain. It just lays down and goes all of the way across the bed, as far as my arm will reach.I am quite surprised by the high performance of this relatively quiet, amazingly light vacuum. I was honestly afraid after Hoover bought them out of bankruptcy last year that Oreck quality would end up like every other great product in a Walmart world. If this is any example, that hasn't happened yet.As an aside -- I also have a Dyson Animal and by comparison, which is difficult because these are completely different types of vacuums, I would say this has equal suction. The Dyson of course comes with a tool for everything and doesn't have a bag. If you don't need all of the attachments, animal grooming tools, hoses, little brushes, then I would DEFINITELY choose this one, simply for the convenience and portability.\",\n",

Although it\\'s not for everybody (i.e., people with hardwood floors may want to stay away) it suits me fine and I recommend it for heating rooms up to roughly 300 square feet especially when the floors are not hardwood.',\n",

First there's sort of a staged arrangement where the air flow passes through a couple of plastic traps and a plastic strainer.  Then it hits the first foam filter that's on the bottom of the removable housing, followed by a paper filter also attached to the removable housing.  Then there's a foam pre-motor filter and finally a HEPA post motor filter.  A full set of filters runs about $25.  Or you can spend about a half hour washing the replaceable ones and only have to buy $19 worth, plus tax and shipping.  We have two cockers so the tare-down is good for about 3 months.\",\n",

And though I loved it, it's time had come.When this arrived it had been sealed into a vacuum bag and required 48-72 hours laid out to reshape itself.  Luck for me I had a spare bedroom to lay the thing on or I don't know what I would have done.  Also it has a foul chemical odor straight out of the bag.  After the 48 hours had gone by the mattress had fluffed up and the odor was gone.  Now when I first placed this on top of my pillow top, my bed was now so high that I had to jump to get on it.  So the following day I removed the pillow top and placed this directly on my box spring.  Now my bed sits extremely low to the ground with this only being 8 inches thick.  This places me within range of the dogs who up until now could not make the jump onto the bed.  Now I am not opposed to a dog sleeping at the foot of my bed, but when my alarm goes off in the morning - I am at the perfect height for early morning sloppy kisses which makes the snooze button pointless.As far as comfort, this is a very nice firm mattress that I actually sleep very well on.  I would recommend it to people who enjoy a firm mattress.  I don't know how well it would hold up over time if I was a heavier person (I am about 115lbs).My only wish is that this was higher because I'm not a fan of sleeping so low to the ground.

It will run on 240 volts, so it will work in other countries, since inmany of them the standard voltage is 240 instead of the 120 here in the USA.  However, the outlets in other countries are also different shapes, so you will need a set of adapters, or at least one for the country you are visiting, and no adapters come with this unit.  Of course many people who travel overseas already have adapters, so that may not be an issue for you.  The only odd thing about this unit is that it says using distilled water will damage the unit.

Everybody was right about how awesome it is at sucking stuff up. I had to laugh about the review from the person who said it filled up the canister too fast.... duhhhhh... so yes, it is doing it's job!!! I have a Dalmatian and she sheds like CRAZY with these very fine white hairs. It does a great job at getting them! It also does a much better job on my tile and hardwood floors which was a pleasant surprise after having a much more expensive vacuum cleaner that just blew the hair/dust all over the place. This one gets it in the canister! It is also a fairly quiet vacuum compared to my last one right out of the box.The only downside I see to this vacuum as someone else already mentioned is the short hose. It causes the vacuum to fall over a lot. However, in all fairness, many of the upright vacuum cleaners have this same issue. Maybe this model will come out with a longer hose next time round. I'll be ordering one right away!Lastly, be sure to order a couple extra belts so you have them on hand for when you need one. They are cheap.\",\n",

I have been airing the thing out for a month and it STILL has that noxious plastic smell. We've had the window open for a month, leaned it up on it's side, stuck pillows inbetween the 2 mattresses to allow the bottom inside plastic to also air, and I wiped it down with a baking soda solution....still the plastic smell. I'm really hoping that it will fade.That, so far, is the only reason the mattress has a 4-star rating from me. Otherwise, it would have 5 stars. The rest of the features are GREAT: It's high enough to sit on just like a regular bed, the mattress cover is wonderful to have, along with the dust ruffle. I bought full-size sheets and they fit the bed beautifully, and being able to tuck them in is great. Outside of the smell, you wouldn't know it was an air bed. I actually slept on the bed earlier and it was very comfortable, even with the smell  (which is why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 3...even with the smell I could sleep on the bed because of its comfort).The bed has been great, for the month that we've had it up. During the past month it has not lost air while it's been set up, turned over and over to air, etc. That's also another plus for us. We love the bed and just hope that the smell will fade much more than it has.\",\n",

I have been told time and again at doctor's office visits to use a humidifier every night. This Vornado Evap3 is not really a bedroom unit (unless you have a very large bedroom) and its generally a little on the noisy side for nighttime use. That said, I tried it in that capacity anyway and with the unit set on &#34;low&#34; I found the noise level to be acceptable. This is going to be highly subjective. Set on &#34;high&#34; it felt too noisy even for a living room/parlor environment. I can't stand having too much moisture in the air, so the &#34;high&#34; setting is also (in my very subjective opinion) too much even in a larger room.As for the wick filters, they do require regular changing as they will mildew over time. It's a pain, quite frankly, and an expense I'm not sure I will want to endure for very long. Basically, humidifiers are a pain in the back to deal with and all of them have their pros and cons. I just don't want to have to buy wick filters every month and worry about making sure to get the right size and hunt for the best price.The water level in the tank is easy to determine at least, and a full tank lasts a good 24-hour period. Like with any humidifier, keep it clean. Be meticulous about this. It has to become part of your routine, as these are not maintenance-free items. And be prepared to change the filters. The Evap3 is relatively lightweight for its size and is basically easy to operate.

Just got off the phone w/Sauder, and they are shipping me out a replacement top shelf today!This would've gotten a review of 4 except for the damage. The unit arrives in Sauder's packaging only, which is quite sturdy and protective, but non-reversible, so that once you unpack this thing, you're not going to package it back up in the original packaging if you need to send it back, so I am keeping it as is. The damage clearly didn't happen in shipping, there was no sign of any shipping distress on the package at all, so the damage happened prior to pr during packaging at the factory. What I have is a vey visible, crescent shaped crack in the laminate on the top surface the TV sits on, on the right side front corner. If it was in the back or on a lower shelf I wouldn't care.As I said, if this weren't the case I'd give this a 4. Sure, it's laminated particle board, but it goes together reasonably quickly -- I put it together in 1.5 hours taking my time, and when together it is very sturdy and looks pretty good. I'm not sure how long the finish will last as others have said it scratches easily, but if I get a few years out of it I'll be happy, although I'd be happier if it didn't come pre-damaged.One other nit-pick I have is that the laminated doesn't cover the edges of the back edges on the top cover, the part that's angled to fit in a corner. This isn't a big deal if you're using this  as intended -- as a corner stand -- but if you wanted to use it against a wall then you'd be looking at a strip of exposed particle board contrasting against the dark laminate about 3 inches long on each side.\",\n",

At full cost I would give it 1 star, since I got it on sale though it gets 3 stars because it was a reasonable value for that cost. Very overpriced otherwise for its value.It does a fair job at a quick cleanup. It will never substitute for a real floor cleaning though. All it is is a handy clean up for in between the real cleanings.\",\n",
       "  'description': 'The Bissell Catch-All vacuum lives up to its name by combining debris collection with dusting power. To make cleaning even easier, the unit operates cordlessly on a rechargeable battery that lasts 15 minutes per charge. Use of the Catch-All is markedly easy. When the handle is tipped to one side, the vacuum engages motorized non-scratching brushes to pick up large debris. Tip it to the other side and you can use the electrostatic dry cloth to snag all the fine particles and dust left on the floor. Suitable for all hard floor surfaces, the vacuum comes with non-marring felt-coated wheels, an easy-empty dust cup with a washable filter, and a simple and tidy charging unit. The battery pack pops off the base to simplify recharging, and an indicator light signals that charging is in progress. Each charge takes 6-8 hours; you can purchase additional battery packs separately to extend run time. Bissell includes a set of starter cloths and a one-year warranty.--Emily Bedard',\n",

I couldn't figure out a way to clean the pet filter without breaking it and it kept shooting out the front of the vacuum because it was full of pet dust.  So I ordered these replacements because the canister filter was pretty worn out.Well, they both work.  The Canister filter fits pretty perfectly.  The pet filter does not.  Whoever designed this didn't take the exact measurements of the original.  It is a credit card's width too short to fit in the slot and will pop out on you.  How do you fix this when you really need to vacuum?  Take an old gift card and place it on the top of the filter sticking out of the vacuum.  Snugged right up.This is not what I want to do, but it's what I'm doing because I'm not trying to show off my vacuum to anyone and it works and I didn't want to go throught the hassle of returning it, etc.As far as I can tell they are both doing well with the filtering and even with the gift card in there I don't notice any loss in suction or dust shooting out the front.It'd be nice if they redesigned to make it fit perfectly.\",\n",

This difference frequently becomes a bit of a problem.  I usually turn the temperature up, but become drowsy and sluggish.So I purchased the \"Slanket Blanket\" for my wife.  This blanket has made a real difference.  The moment I presented it to my wife she wrapped herself in it and praised it.  She is now warm and cozy, and I turned the temperature down in our house.  She is comfortable and so am I.  I love it.The \"Slanket Blanket\" is made of excellent material.  When I examine it, I see the same quality as the blankets on my bed.

The Slanket takes an everyday conundrum - staying warm on the sofa when you haven't got (a) a boyfriend, (b) a girlfriend, or (c) a winter fuel allowance - and responds to the challenge with typically American aplomb... namely taking a couple of existing ideas and, to coin a phrase, hybridising them. Think of the Slanket as a genetic cross-breed between a fleece and a blanket and you're there. Alternatively, one may think of it as Big Daddy's dressing gown. A fluffy house coat. A Jedi cape, without the hood. The Slanket is, in short, a gigantic fleece blanket with sleeves. Pop it on and disappear inside its cuddly massiveness and be enveloped by its sheer fleeciness. Then simply pop Friends on the DVD. Open a massive bag of Maltesers. And who needs mates? Soft to the touch, lightweight and warm, it's got large, loose sleeves so you don't actually feel you're wearing it. Which might defeat the purpose, but who are we to argue? Spiffing.\",\n",

I have read several reviews for similar items, and I decided to go with this one. I am happy that I made the right decision.My husband\\'s job requires him to wear a uniform, a utility belt, a vest, and other gear. We have a closet in a room on the first floor at the back of the house where he keeps his uniforms. Half of that closet is where I keep my shoes and purses. He likes to prepare his stuff the night before so that he will not have to spend time looking for stuff the next morning. He is responsible and efficient like that. His routine is to hang his uniform for the next day on the doorknob outside the door on his side of the closet. As for me, this annoyed me because when I want to open my side of the closet, his uniform and the hanger are barricading the door. I cannot open my side of the closet because his uniform, or the hanger that had his uniform, was still hanging on the doorknob of the other door. I had to take the uniform off the door, put it somewhere, get my shoes, then close the door and put back his uniform. It is an extra step for me to do and it was very annoying because he was being inconsiderate. My solution then was to stick a large 3M Command Hook on the inside of the door on his side of the closet so that he can hang his chosen uniform where it will not be in the way of opening the door. That worked for a while. It still works until now, but then he started hanging things outside the closet door that in the entryway close to the front door.  There was an over-the-door wreath hanger on the closet door that I hung there temporarily after the holidays and then forgot about it.  So he started using that as his temporary hook in case he needed to hang something by the front door. This was an eye sore. Yes the wreath hanger serves the same purpose but it does not look nice. He says, \"This will do for now.\" But this is not a dorm or apartment where you know your stay is temporary. We have a nice new house and things like this will just not do.So then my search began for the perfect over-the-door hook....I wanted something that looked nice and presentable especially if it is for the entryway area. So this disqualified all the plastic hooks from consideration. I focused on polished chrome or satin nickel hooks. I read so many reviews and decided on this one. It looks good, better than the photo. It has some weight to it, so I know it will not bend easily and will be able to hold a few items of clothing on hangers if necessary. When we received the package (Amazon Prime, 2-day shipping), I asked my husband to place the hook on the door to give him some participation (he is way taller anyway). So the hook fit perfectly. Not too big, and not tight. It was just right.  Measurements were exactly as described.  Also, it looks good. It doesn\\'t look like something you would buy for a dorm room or an apartment.  When you have a house, you would want to buy things that are nice and good quality.  I will buy more for our bedroom doors.If you are deciding to get this, make sure you check the measurement of your door and compare it to the measurement of the opening of this hook. The measurement in the product description is pretty accurate.  Hope this review helps.',\n",

Its small size will stay out of the way from other items. The casing is flimsy since the metal housing is made of very thin, soft metal; so you can't be abusive with it.The great part about the dry pack is that it is reusable. Once it absorbs too much moisture, I can just put it in the oven on low heat and it will dry out and be ready for the next use (unlike the small paper silica packs).

I never had any problems getting my apartment clean very quickly with that basic setup, and I think for most people it stops there. If you don\\'t have a specific problem (like pets), chances are you won\\'t need this extra attachment.But in my case, things changed when we got a Persian cat. The carpets would all of a sudden completely refuse to get clean! Worse even, after a few swipes, the hair ended up being arranged into thick threads that then stubbornly stuck to the carpet, requiring me to disconnect the floor tool, and take in the thing with the hose. What it came down to is, I spent 15 minutes per carpet and not really getting it clean - very frustrating.Cue this product, which helped tremendously! You have to move rather slowly on the carpet to let the brushes do their work, and sometimes lift it up so that the brushes can spin up again. It\\'s still not completely effortless, but it does get the carpets very clean within reasonable time. It\\'s quite a sanity- safer.The reason I\\'m withholding one star is because there is no way to turn off the brushes. They\\'re always on, and making quite a ruckus on hardwood floor. Suction is permanently reduced as well, and the fast/slow switch works by opening a hole on the top, making things even worse. Because of all this, I find myself switching floor tools. It would be so much nicer if Miele had found a way to stop the brushes without reducing suction.Another small negative (but not enough to downgrade my opinion of it) is that it doesn\\'t come apart easily for cleaning. One has to unscrew two plastic screws and even then the brush stays in. By comparison, the brush on my Roomba comes out completely with just a yank.',\n",

I have innerspring and memory foam mattresses in my home and my son has always preferred the memory foam beds so I was excited to have the opportunity to try this mattress.If this is your first memory foam mattress, you\\'ll notice it arrives rolled and compressed into a relatively compact size box, but is quite weighty for it\\'s size. To allow it to expand, take the still rolled and compressed mattress to the bed frame or box spring you\\'ll be using it on before opening it. CAREFULLY slit the plastic (without cutting the mattress or cover) and the mattress will immediately begin expanding into shape. DreamFoam, like virtually every other memory foam mattress manufacturer, suggests waiting 24-48 hours before sleeping on it to allow for full expansion, however, my son slept on it the first night.This is an 8\" mattress and mine actually measures slightly over 8\". The cover is a plush, white, knit velour which is carved into a gorgeous pattern of roses. I was also completely surprised to find two, standard size memory foam pillows included! They are covered in the same white velour fabric, but the pillow is made of shredded memory foam chunks. I have to say I LOVE these pillows! They are so much more comfortable for me than those small, strangely shaped, solid-slab memory foam pillows.There is a slight odor to the mattress and somewhat more of an odor to the pillows upon opening the packaging. Because I have a sensitive nose, I opened the windows in the bedroom for the first day and the smell dissipated quickly.This mattress is what I would consider soft. I have a firm memory foam mattress that I sleep on and this one is much, much softer, while still being completely supportive. This is the least expensive mattress I have in my home and after sleeping on it myself one night, I\\'m shocked to find that the quality rivals the most expensive memory foam bed I have! This was a huge surprise to me. I always assumed that in bedding, you get what you pay for but in this case, price is not a measure of quality. If you need a replacement mattress, this one is a great choice at a great price.',\n",

I called Sears and they said there is no 5 year warranty on the motor - just a 1 year limited warranty. Cannot believe this. And we are not huge cleaners either. We use it once a week on the carpet in the living room and then every other week for the rest of the house. Not a huge amount. Up until it broke I liked it.

This is not a vacuum for everyone, as the weight will make it uncomfortable for some people to use, expecialy if one has stairs, as dragging the vacumm up and down them isn't going to be too easy.  The vacuum weight nearly 18 pounds and I find it much to heavy.I have to admit that I had a lot of expectations for this vacuum cleaner, but it didn't live up to them. Immediately after cleaning the carpet, I decided to vacuum again with my Shark Navigator (which costs less than half of the price of the Samsung). Imagine my surprise when I noticed how much dirt the Samsung MotionSync Bagless Upright Vacuum left behind.The next thing that I'd like to write about is a detachable hand vacuum, which is designed to serve us as helpful in reaching the hard-to-reach areas using attached accessories. Unfortunately, these accessories do not come with a vacuum cleaner. The only tool that is included, it's a fine nozzle. I can't imagine using the manual vacuum cleaner longer than 5 minutes. It is very heavy and not suitable for extended housework.The manufacturer claims it is easy to maneuver thel vacuum -- but  I can not agree with this. The cambered and hollow wheels don't make it easy to push at all. Just moving it forward isn't an easy task.  During vacuuming is much easier to push, but swifting from side to side is not as easy as vacuumes I have had the oportunity to use.Another thing I don't like is the lack of option to set the height of the carpet. While the vacuum cleaner performs well on low carpets and hard floors, it has huge difficulties in moving on slightly higher carpets.On the positive side, it is a very solid vacuum.  Each part of the vacuum perfectly matches the rest of it.  The buttons for turning on and off the unit or brush were installed at the height of the palm of your hand, so there is no need to bend down.  Furthermore, I really like the dust tank , which is esay to empty with just one hand.  Also, I really like the long cord which is almost 30 feet, which makes it easy to work without finding a new outlet.In conclusion, I would not recommend this vacuum cleaner to elderly people because of its weight. In itself it isn't bad, but for this price you can get something much better.\",\n",

It\\'s a slightly flexible, on the thin side, plastic (old style was heavier, thicker, and much more flexible, like rubber(maid).)It also appears that there is a frame wrapping all the way around the bottom (inset)so it may be harder for air to get under there and dry things out. Other than that I think the rest of my review stands.Honestly, after checking out the prices (call it the price jump) on the other brands I think that Rubbermaid\\'s products may not be made as sturdily as they used to be but for the price I\\'d say the quality (compared to the Euro-crap out there) is an awesome value.ORIGINAL: I\\'ve had one of these for 4-5? years.Yes, it drains from the long side. The picture at the time I am writing this clearly shows this.  At first I didn\\'t like this side-ways configuration; then I realized that it takes up less counter space. It uses space more efficiently.  So now I have enough room for my knife block set. Win, win!It also has a ramp built into it that tilts it towards the sink and I have found that it drains water much better than the old style did. Plus any water that gets underneath the tray dries up pretty quickly due to the air space created by the built-in ramp. I have NEVER had any kind of mold or mildew problem with this tray and I am BAD about keeping an eye out for water under the tray. My tray stays on the counter 24/7.The drain-lip does not extend beyond the edge of the tray (the portion that the rack sits on) but I found that if you push the tray just beyond the edge of the sink it drains fine.  Note: 1. This does take away from the available space of the sink because the rack moves down too (along with the tray) and gets in the way. Also,the feet of the rack (also Rubbermaid)have made a slight indentation in the tray which traps a tiny puddle of water. Not awful but it does require me to clean the tray more frequently than I normally would. I anticipate that in time (A few years) this indentation MIGHT turn into a crack but I\\'d have replaced it before then just because well...how long can one woman stand the same drain tray?I am shopping for drain racks today and if I purchase a rack that is compatible (size, style and color etc.) with my current drain-tray I will might continue to use it.

It would be a perfect gift for a young person moving into their first apartment or a newlywed couple getting their first home! I live in a cabin and love the neutral brown colors. It fits in nicely with my decor but also has a bit of a feminine touch- which I really like to have in a bathroom.The rugs are VERY soft! They feel like carpet! And I really love stepping out of the bath and onto them. They're quite comfy. But I was expecting them to be a bit bigger. The toilet rug is extends only about 12 inches from the base of the toilet- which really doesn't cover much room. The other rug is decent in size, but still isn't nearly as big as I thought it would be by judging from the picture. I would estimate it's about 24 inches across and 13 inches wide.The shower curtain is not cloth- although they say it is. It's plastic, but even so it looks very pretty. The design is subtle and looks very 'Ancient Rome' in the design. I find it very pretty! The tan and brown also are nice because they don't get dirty as quickly as white does. The shower curtain rings were covered in the same exact fabric as the curtain. Some of them were a bit frayed. And the rings didn't seem too sturdy. I might end up using my old ones, because I fear these ones just won't hold up. But they do look nice.The towels are light-weight. They're definitely not for every day use. But they do look lovely as a decoration. They are very soft and would make nice hand towels. It comes with one full size bath towel, one hand towel, and one wash cloth. The design you see on the edge is actually the same material as the shower curtain (sort of a plastic fabric), so although it looks lovely it isn't really functional. I'm also a bit worried that the white color will get grungy fast, but I've only had them hanging for a week, so time will tell. They do add a nice accent to the towel holder though. For a guest bathroom I think they would be beautiful.All in all, for the price I am quite pleased. I wish it were all a bit better quality, but I can't complain.

(Yes, they should have each bag sealed separately for keeping the smell in.)  Next, when I went to open the package of the small scented card that was attached to the bag per the instructions, it fell off of the bag.  It smelled nice so I just stuck in the vacuum with the bag.  Installing the bag in my Hoover Windtunnel T-series was a cinch.I personally do not like the scent of the bags.  It bothered me so much that after vacuuming about 600 square feet of carpet, I tossed the bags because they made me nauseous and gave me a headache.  After having read the other reviews on this product, I'm convinced that there's a problem with consistency for this product.  It's funny to me that some people had bags without much scent.  Not the case here!  The scent of the bags even lightly lingered in the basement that I had vacuumed for about an hour.A strong scent like this might be a plus for smoking households or those with indoor pets.  It's just not for me and it's a shame for people who want that strong smell, that it sounds like not everyone gets bags as strongly scented as mine.  I'd have to agree that it's best to stick with the bags made by Hoover.  They really are of better quality.  Get your scent fix in another way.\",\n",

The box was large, holding a fully assembled ottoman, and it was packed with care.  The cardboard was thick and sturdy.  I opened it from the bottom side so that I could slip the box off the top.  The feet were wrapped in bubble wrap, and there was thick foam padding protecting it further from the stress of transportation.  I gently turned it over and lifted the box from the ottoman.  There was more cardboard to remove, revealing a drawstring slipcover that helped protect the leather from rubbing against the cardboard.  It untied easily to reveal the ottoman.I'm not sure what I expected, but I felt pleasantly surprised!  The BEST Cambridge Leather Storage Ottoman is well constructed and feels very sturdy.  The padded top is very comfortable and just the right height to rest my feet on, but it is also super soft for sitting.  The legs are nicely finished and blend well with the brown color of the leather.The lid raises up on heavy duty hinges that look like they will last a long time and they glide very smoothly.  There are three hinges across the back of the lid, and of course the two side hinges that hold the lid up without allowing it to slam shut.The inside is lined in a black fabric, and the seams are well hidden.  The lining fabric doesn't feel heavy duty, though, it feels like it might tear if I'm not careful.  The space inside is very roomy, and the bottom is solid so I don't have to worry about anything being too heavy to put in it.The leather is smooth and soft.  The top is made up of 6 sections, each seamed well together.  There are two tufts in the lid which are screaming for buttons, but there are none.  It doesn't detract from the design though.  The sides appear nearly seamless, with visible seams only on the corners.  The leather is bonded leather, which means there could be multiple pieces of leather which are chemically processed to fuse them together and appear as one piece.  I would have never know if the leather was bonded or even real leather if it weren't for the Amazon product description.  The label on the bottom of the ottoman only disclosed the contents of the padding and lining fabric and made no reference to the leather at all.I'm very, very happy with this ottoman.  It's comfortable, well made, attractive, and offers much needed storage space.  It's great in the living room, but the size would be perfect at the foot of a bed to hold linens.  It's very versatile!\",\n",

The steam is hot.  It leaves the floor wet but dries quickly.But what you have to fight to get there is not worth it.Cons: Almost everything- You have to hold the handle down for the steam to come out - I rigged it with a strong rubber band as it tired my hands out.- The cord is just not long enough and there is not a cord clasp to keep it out of your way as you are cleaning.  The bottom cord holder is so far down on the handle that when you try to wrap the cord around it, you hit the body of the machine.- The plug is weighted heavily so the slightest movement and out it comes - I tried pushing the prongs apart but that didn't help so now I plug it into a power strip - isn't that fun?- The Accessory kit won't stay on if the machine is at a stand still much less in movement.  Really?  They couldn't figure out to fasten a plastic carrier on?- Hard to push.  I keep looking down to see if the wheels are really moving since pushing this thing is like pushing rubber across carpet.  I'm going to try a microfiber cloth and see if that helps.- It runs out of water just cleaning my small kitchen.- When I pull the water tank stopper out, the whole rubber plug comes out.  So I have to ever sooooo gently pull it and hold the other part down to keep that from happening.- There are a lot of tools but seriously, I'm not going to use them so it's a waste.  I did pull it out to use as a hand held model but I could not see any difference in the cleanliness of the sink so who wants to drag the thing around.I'm using it because I paid for it and I don't want it go to waste -- but I feel foolish getting stuck with this machine.\",\n",

When they arrived at my house, I opened them up, took on look at them and immediately got back online to review the listing for these sheets.  The seller should be tarred and feathered for listing these as Egyptian cotton!  If you look at the product description it says only 3 words - Egyptian Cotton Quality.  Too bad none of the three words can be used to describe these sheets.  Paper thin poly fibers, not even a cotton-poly blend!  While I will never sleep on these sheets, they did work well as a drop cloth when I painted our bedroom.  You definitely get what you pay for with these sheets.  Unless you need a good drop cloth for painting, these sheets should be avoided.',\n",

The heat type have their own separate set of problems,not addressed here as this is not that type of unit.This means two things:1) They need complete cleaning regularly2) They need new \"filters\" (actually moisture wicks) regularlySo this unit does work and gets the room it is in reasonably moist.The unit is able to raise the humidity by about 5-20 percent. 20 close to the unit,5 further away. It is way too noisy on the high setting, quite nice on the low setting,OK on the middle setting as long as you do not need to be in that room for a long time.I have found that after about 2-4 weeks the filters will need to be replaced so factor thatinto your cost.A big tissue is that as with way too many products, this (and I suspect most alternatives)have lots of nooks and crevices and crannies that are a total pain to clean very well. If youwant to get this unit really clean, plan to take it outdoors, use a high pressure hose on thenon-electrical parts, and partially disassemble the fan housings (thereby involving electricalparts so be sure you know what you are doing). A complete clean can take 45 minutes to an hourof work but you will not get it clean without the effort. Also plan to do this every 2-4 weeks.Bottom line, works OK but is a pain to maintain. OTOH, I doubt the alternatives are much eaiser- just a fact of life with humidifiers.Update: I have stopped using this on reccomendation of my pulmunologist. He says that this typecan spew fungus into the air. In addition, after checking the humidity in an adjacent room withit running and then again after not using it for two weeks (similar weather, BTW), there was onlyabout 4-5 percent difference in humidity. I strongly suspect that if you want good whole house you willneed a unit built into your house\\'s HVAC system.',\n",

Nothing short of ironing works to eliminate the wrinkles.  The shams are too large for every queen size pillow I own and look sloppy even after ironing.  The flanges are skimpy (@ 1&#34;) and trimmed with satin piping.  The sewing thread was not well-suited to the fabric so it shrank but the fabric didn't, and the result is a puckered mess.

The directions also draw the Pre/Charcoal filter as being about 1/3 as thick as the Hepa Filter and they write about it in what I think is a misleading way(page E-5 in the manual). This \"Pre-/Charcoal Filter\" as they call it is simply a thin, very thin, layer of foamy like substance (I\\'ll take their word for it about the Charcoal) that uses a velcro-like strip at the top to attach to the HEPA. Then they number the filters like this:1. Pre-Filter combined with2. Charcoal Filter3. Hepa FilterSo I was looking for a 3rd item. You can stop looking.  It\\'s that thin foamy thing that they\\'re \"wordsmithing\\' to sound more important that it looks.  And believe me, it doesn\\'t look like much.The controls are manual, with a Lo, Med, and Hi ability that when turned, light up the rather LONG green power light.

If you want it to last a long time and have it for a couple years, I would recommend putting it somewhere less busy in your house. Because my rug is in my bathroom, without a doubt I will have to wash it so I have yet to see if the colors will bleed but I read up on color bleeding and they say to wash your rich dye items in cold water with a cup of color fast laundry detergent and a cup of regular table salt.

I have always owned 3 vacuum cleaners at all times- we have a Shark for our house carpets, a Shop Vac for our basement and garage and we have always owned a Dirt Devil Bagless Power Reach for our carpeted stairs, vehicle carpets and tight spaces that are hard to reach. Our Dirt Devil Power Reach is a hand held vac that is very heavy to hold and has a long cord that when on the stairs can get twisted around your feet, causing problems. I have always wished for a Dirt Devil that was as light as a feather without a cord for cleaning stairs.Dirt Devil must have heard me, as this is beyond wonderful for my needs. This Quick Flex 2 in 1 is as light as a feather. It has a good enough vacuum for our carpeted stairs and cars, as when we go in one direction, it lifts and cleans the nap perfectly. With no cord to trip anyone up doing the steps, it's a true life saver. I can reach anywhere- under dressers, low beds and tight corners. The vacuum can be used standing up or remove the hand held vac for complete light cordless cleaning. This is a huge issue when you are older, to be able to hold a vacuum that doesn't kill your wrist and not get your legs or feet twisted up in a long cord when balancing on stairs. This also comes with one attachment- a tiny brush- very handy for lifting the low nap in car carpets. The most important thing to remember is to clean the dirt cup and filter after every use- the filter is so tiny, that cleaning it makes it perfect for the suction you will need for your next use.What used to take us 15 minutes to vacuum the stairs now takes 5 minutes with such a light weight and cordless easy to use hand vac. We charge it after every 2 uses and have had no issues ever. Dirt Devil has a one year warranty, as with our other heavy corded Power Reach, but we know they last way longer, as that vacuum has passed it's decade mark already and still runs like new.  For it's light weight and great cleaning when you keep the cup and filter clean, it deserves 5 Stars. If it lasts as long as our Dirt Devil Power Reach, it will deserve 10 Stars. It's just wonderful to have a vacuum that saves an older person's knees and back bending up and down steps in a much shorter time too, and for that alone I would give it 5 Stars.\",\n",

But, I was a bit lost as to exactly to what degree they were improving the air quality in my house...I had no way of really knowing. I also found the filter replacement times somewhat vague. You replace them based on keeping track of how many hours you have run your air cleaner at a given fan speed--the higher the fan speed, the fewer total hours of run time until you need to change each filter. This does not seem like the best way of knowing when to replace these costly items.Doesn't it make sense that if there is not so much dust in your house, but a lot of dust in someone else's house, that running an identical air cleaner for the same amount of time and fan speed as the people in the other house is going to mean that your filters are not going to be plugged up as quickly as theirs? And, in order to save energy on the electric bill, how do I know what is the lowest fan speed to use to actually keep my air clean, given the size of my room and the actual dust that it contains or that flows into the room from doors and windows?I started doing some research online and eventually came across this device.I bought one of these Dylos air quality monitors and now that I am using it, I couldn't imagine running good air cleaners without one. It gives you an immediate readout of the quantity of particles floating around in your air, and a scale to tell you what that means. It allows you to see what is going on in your room, with your air cleaner, with your dust problem at this moment as it is affected by the outside air currents, etc.. This will make it possible to determine the best fan speed, and also allows you to tell the condition of your filters by measuring the clean air output of your air cleaner. You replace your filters when they are not filtering properly anymore, not when some arbitrary timer tells you to. I can move the Dylos from room to room to check, as it is small and light.For the small cost of this device relative to electric costs and filter costs, it is a steal in the long run. I have no affiliation with Dylos. They have been well reviewed elsewhere and make the most reasonable particle counter on the market. It works for me, and I just thought I'd pass it along.\",\n",

That handheld was excellent when it worked. But it suffered from very short battery life from the day it was new (5-7 minutes max) and, after a few months, started to manifest a problem where the vacuum would only operate for a few seconds between trigger activations. As I subsequently learned, this was a common problem.So, while I really liked the DC34 initially, I grew to dislike it immensely over time. In fact, before I got this DC58, I\\'d switched to a reasonable mid-line Black and Decker model. It never picked up dirt like the Dyson did at its best. But it also didn\\'t give me any troubles and held a charge much longer.OK, enough back story. How is this new DC58 model?In terms of addressing the biggest out-of-the-box problem with the earlier model--short battery life--they\\'ve done something very clever here. Basically, they now offer the user two power step operation. In the lower power mode, the battery lasts 15-20 minutes. In high power mode (Dyson calls it \"Boost Mode\"), you are back to the old 5-7 minutes of operation. The key here, though, is that for many/most cleaning operations, the lower power mode is perfectly fine. In fact, after testing out both modes, I pretty much stuck to the lower power mode for all my subsequent cleaning tests. The only place where I had to switch back into Boost Mode was to clean some junk out from a narrow crack between the seats in my car. I couldn\\'t get the nozzle far enough down to pull the stuff in using the standard mode, but in boost mode, the suction pulled everything through the air the small extra distance necessary.Generally, this Dyson, like other Dyson vacuums, demonstrates a clear advantage over cheaper brands in terms of being able to maintain very good suction even as it fills up. With my Black and Decker, for example, I am continually having to open the vacuum up to clean the filter--often in the middle of a job--because the suction is deteriorating. No such problems with the Dyson.Cleaning (open the canister, dump into your garbage) is about the same as the old Dyson handheld, and is better than, say, my Black and Decker (due to less problems with the filter getting clogged and needing cleaning). The attachment set is minimal, just like my previous handheld Dyson. But, to be honest, I only use the straight extender wand anyway.So Dyson has won me back to the fold. Whether I remain there depends on whether the battery/electrical system on this one stays the course long term. I am hoping that the obvious implementation of changes to the power system (two speeds) suggests they\\'ve addressed other issues as well.',\n",

Maybe once I get my house to where I vacuum each room each week, it won't be so bad.  But as it stands now I spend about 3 minutes cleaning it out each time I use it.  I think I care about the Roomba more.  I should have been cleaning my regular vacuum out just as often, but I hated it, so I didn't.Rugs are a problem.  I have to take them up off the floor every time I vacuum.  The guide says to fold the fringe under, but that doesn't cut it.  The Roomba just thinks it's furniture and doesn't go up on it.  Basically even the mats in the bathroom and welcome mats need to be taken up off the floor every time you vacuum a room.Something else I have noticed is that you do need a hand vacuum for small spills if you don't want to haul out the Roomba.  You also need one for the stairs.  But I haven't vacuumed the stairs in two years, so the Roomba takes care of most of my vacuuming needs.

It has several nice features, not the least of which is a cute floral design on the hard plastic case. The wand extends with a press of a lever, and another lever on the floor attachment switches it from carpet to floor mode. Also, the 5 1/2-inch wheels move fairly easily along both carpet and bare floors. There is a variable suction switch that allows some degree of suction, however, my experience was that it needed to be set to the highest suction to be effective. A built-in handle makes this easy to carry and a decent choice for a small apartment or dorm. As for a larger house, the unit is a bit on the underpowered side to be truly effective.The Dirt Devil comes with one canister bag installed and two more provided, however, they are small and will require frequent changing. Packages of three (Type O) bags are available through Amazon. A tiny crevice tool and dusting brush are included. The crevice tool is useful for tight areas and both store conveniently on the wand. The 20-foot cord retracts into the canister with the press of a button mounted on top. Also mounted on top is the ON/OFF switch which can be hand or foot operated. Also, there are two filters, a pre-motor filter and an exhaust filter that can be removed to wash.I found the carpet/floor attachment to deliver only minimal cleaning, better on bare floors than carpets where a beater type attachment is needed.

The LED light can't be turned off, so I had to do a little frontier medicine and remove the LED entirely. The loss of the LED doesn't affect the air purificer function whatsoever though.The &#34;whooshing&#34; sound it makes is relaxing, but unless you use purified water, the funnel and bowel will be discolored and acquire a grainy texture from the minerals in the water. It works great even with the discoloration, so I don't really bother using purified water myself, but it's something to keep in mind. You have to clean and refill the bowl every 2-3 days if you leave it on 24-7. It's powered by USB, so if you want to plug it into a wall you'll have to get a AC/USB adapter because one isn't included.\",\n",

There was a lot to unwrap in this box.  I got it put together without using the instructions.  It comes with a lot of little parts for a variety of jobs, which is nice.  The mop itself has a telescoping pole and loops for cord wrapping.  The cord is nice and long and the unit does heat up instantly, which is a huge bonus!  The dial tells you where to set it for various jobs: fabric being the lowest, then mop, all the way to handheld which is the highest.  The difference between the lowest and highest settings seems to be how fast the steam comes out. I am unsure if the temperature is actually higher or not.When I was done mopping, the velcro attached cleaning pad was hot to the touch. I am not sure how well the velcro will fare in the washing machine.  The pad only slipped a little bit while mopping; not enough to stop and adjust.I prefer a triangle shaped head over a rectangle one, but this one got in the corners \"ok\".  The steam did not do a great job getting down in the grout, nor on the edges of the pad. It did slightly better on the highest heat, but runs out of water quicker that way, of course.  If you want something light and small to do a wide variety of jobs, this will probably be a great unit.  For floors, not my favorite.  But I consider the instant heating to make up for a lot of what is lacking.',\n",

My husband  vacuumed when he really wanted to make me feel spoiled.I have been looking for a good affordable machine.  I read all the reviews before ordering this machine.  I was skeptical.  Before using the animal, I vacuumed my whole house with the Hover.  I was surprised when I vacuumed with the animal, that I had to empty the canister twice.  It does such a good job that I no longer keep throw rugs in front of my cat's litter pans.With my Hover my husband only needed to change the bag twice a year.  Now when he comes home from work, I show off the huge mounds of cat hair and dust in the trash can.  He loves not having to mess with the bags.  I was afraid that I would be driven crazy by the strange color of the machine, but it has grown on me.The machine is so easy to use.  I can clean my whole house very quickly and never break a sweat.  My cats don't care for the animal, because even months after the new has worn off, I am still running it around the house at the least provocation.I found it works on all surfaces including my area rugs.  You have to be careful around the corners of the rugs, but if you run it from the middle of the rug to the corners it works so well, you won't have to take the rugs to the cleansers so often.

       " 'B000GZ4FLO': {'Best review': \"I have owned this guy since it came out and am very happy with the product, but the manual could use some improvement.Used properly you'll get years of trouble free, cheap and clean air.  The chief concern with a unit of this type is ozone production.  Ozone is *bad* for you.  This unit is *the* best rated unit for ozone production and its ozone levels are very safe -- *IF* the unit is properly serviced.What the manual doesn't tell you -- if you smell ozone you need to clean the element.  You will need to clean the element a lot.  If you cant/won't do that, this is not the air cleaner you are looking for.The second problem with the manual is the cleaning directions are frankly harmful.  The manual says to use dish detergent.  The dish detergent will react with the aluminum and over a long enough time line turning the element black.  This deposit will act like a dielectric (just like the dirt the element collects naturally) and the thing will spew out ozone. Once this had happened I could not get the element clean again and had to replace it.I suggest you clean the element in your dishwasher, with *no* soap and no jet dry.  Fill the soap bucket with pure white vinegar and do a light wash.  It will come out sparkling clean and so far mine has not changed colors -- sometimes simple is better.  Vinegar is a natural aluminum cleaner.  Do *NOT* add cream of tartar or baking soda (this is a common aluminum cleaning recipe) -- this will get baked on to the element and it will *never* come off.  Ask me how I found out? :-)Lastly, the element is a very standard Honeywell element.  You can purchase one for around $125 from online HVAC sites should yours become soiled or damaged (the part # is stamped on the side of the element).\",\n",

Well, I received mine the other day and immediately noticed it's a lot larger than the picture suggests. With that said, definitely measure.First issue encountered was trying to find an appropriate spot. This thing isn't functional enough to fit anywhere... I couldn't place it in a cabinet because the doors wouldn't close properly (the design of this thing is slightly bulky and uneven, so you may not get a proper door close once it is mounted). So, I ended up placing it under the bottom cabinet, meaning it is hanging out the bottom of the cabinet in plain sight, which leads me to my second issue.. It is unsightly. The design is not slim or sleek, but rather it's somewhat bulky and obstructing. When it comes to the kitchen, the more hidden unnecessary items are, the better. It isn't in my favor to walk into my kitchen and see it hanging out from the bottom of my cabinet. Some might consider that a petty argument against the product, to which I would somewhat agree, but ultimately I would like to get what I expect out of a product.I have this product 3 stars because it does work (for the most part) as advertised, but the likelihood of it actually functioning well with a cabinet is to be considered.\",\n",

       " 'B00B1SNMYG': {'Best review': \"Just received this heater. Paid $51. with shipping for it from a reputable source with 30 day returns. Looked it over and have it running full tilt currently. My impression is that it is worth a few bucks more than some of the cheaper plastic heaters. It's about all steel on the exterior and heavy to be so small- very small. Like the rest, it's made in China but it looks fairly well made. It has a tilt shut off safety that kills the power when the unit tilts about 45 degrees or more to the front or rear but not when it tilts to either side. Claims to also have a thermal safety. Seems to be putting out plenty of intense heat at 1500 watts. It's fan forced heat so it does make the typical noise of a fan forced heater... If you want something quiet, get an oil filled radiator type space heater (my favorite type for safety). It's UL LISTED. If it should fail or act up, will update this review.Jan 22, 2011, Due to its small size, the outer metal housing does get fairly hot in places. Would not place it on a flammable surface other than wood or tile, etc. It's still working fine. The thermostat control is sensitive when it's running hard and hot on the high setting. Sometimes it will turn off and on too rapidly. Otherwise, it works fine.Summer 2012: My only complaint is that the thermostat control is somewhat hypersensitive- it will cycle the heater off and on fast sometimes when it gets the room warm. It still gets the job done. Per the reviews I read before this purchase, one should be prepared to return this heater if he receives a bad one. Think a lot of the negative reviews are simply bogus.Upped my rating from 3 to 4 stars. Would buy another one like this if I needed it.Jan 2013: Purchased another one for 51.29 with shipping. May get another RV in the future. Two of these heaters would be just right for a smaller RV to avoid using onboard LP gas... The thermostat on the second one is somewhat sensitive like the first one but they put out heat. When it's cold, that's what matters. The thermostats just cycle off and on more rapidly than most portable heaters.March 2013: Purchased a third one. Therefore, this must be a decent heater in my picky opinion. They are versatile little heaters that don't take up much space. Upped my rating from four stars to five. It's a good little heater. Being so small is an appealing factor to me. Saw the thermal safety work once on the first one I bought. Had the airflow blocked partially. The red caution light came on and the heater shut down to cool...Have them rigged to use in whatever rooms are occupied so it'll be toasty only where needed while maintaining the overall home at a lower, more energy efficient temperature.Oct 25, 2013: Just ordered a fifth one. Haven't received a defective one yet. Being that the thermostat is located near the heating element, that has some effect on the operation of the thermostat control.These little fan forced heaters heat up the air in a room more quickly but my favorite space heater for leaving on night and day inside a home is still a quiet, oil filled, radiator type space heater. Can sit a pot of water on top of them (on the models with a flat top) to add moisture to the air when the humidity drops too low. My respiratory system is able to quickly tell when the air gets too dry.\",\n",

It looks just as good as it does in the picture!Now with that being said, a lot of people are calling it flimsy and weak.  Well duh, you don't sit on this thing.  It's pretty sturdy, it can hold over 100 lbs, but not if that 100 lbs is rocking and swaying.  But its pretty strong for how light it is.  Most of the strongest desks that you can sit on weigh over 300+ lbs and I don't like dealing with all that weight.I've had to finally replace my old desk made by the same company after five years with it.  Not because it finally broke.  No, it was still strong and sturdy as ever.  But it was mostly because it was starting to peel after years of abuse and leaving liquids on the surface.  It was actually smaller than this one that they are currently selling, but unfortunately they don't sell that anymore.  I bought this desk even after all the negative reviews and wow I can say that I am pleasantly surprised.Pros:-  The finish looks great.-  All the pieces fit.-  Assembly is easy, just look at the pictures!-  Packing is superb, very nice protection during shipping!-  Extra hardware just in case you loose some-  You don't really need 2 people to build it, I just lean some parts on the wall if I have to while building.-  Very spacious!-  Super affordable-  Very light for a computer desk-  Can fit a screen of up to 30 inchesCONS:-  Can fit a screen of up to 30 inches only, and no more.  But that is only under the hutch.  If you want to put a bigger monitor on, it can certainly support it, just on other side of the L.I put my books, monitor, fresh pizza, mp3 player and speakers on this desk and it has NO trouble holding all that weight.  What do people who complain about the flimsiness do?  Have sex on it?  I write on it, type on it, lay my head and arms on it sometimes and it works just fine!  Yes its going to vibrate easier than those 300lb desks (or 500lb if they have a hutch!) though, which I expected.  This is a great desk for those who don't want to spend too much money and don't need to have sex/dance on a computer desk.\",\n",

(see my full review there)In comparison, the Bissell is much heavier and unwieldy, both to lug up and down stairs, to fill and empty, and to clean after using. The scrub brushes are like the beater brush on a vacuum, which is difficult if you have pets. Even with vacuuming prior to cleaning, the pet hair can clog up the Bissell cleaning brush, necessitating stopping, taking it apart, etc.The water reservoirs in this model are technically separated, but the clean water is in a plastic water reservoir inside the dirty water tank. Very unpleasant to empty. After using, it was difficult getting all the water out of the carpet cleaner, and there always seemed to be a little dirty water left under the tank that would smell if you didn't heft it into the utility sink and rinse out. I did mention that it's heavy, right?The suction on the Hoover is much better, and in comparison, the Bissell does leave the carpet fairly wet. When it leaves water, it also leaves dirt in the carpet. With pet accidents, you want every little bit pulled out of the carpet!In our opinion, the Hoover is a much better product than the Bissell, and rivals having carpets cleaned professionally.\",\n",

However, it's my fault for not looking at the picture/product description more closely.What is different is that the knobs aren't the same as the Sonoma set. The style is slightly different and I believe they're plastic, rather than metal. Also, the drawers on this are flush with the edges unlike the 6-drawer Sonoma, which has some space on either side that I think makes it look more elegant and matches the set better. The 7-drawer also doesn't have the curvy kickstand.Those are small things that I could live with more easily if the major difference wasn't that the drawers don't have metal gliders. The drawers themselves just have a notch that slides on plastic gliders. Because of this, they do not open and close smoothly, and a couple of the drawers I have to hold the whole unit itself to open and close, they're really tight. I'm hoping a little bit of time will loosen them up slightly. You get what you pay for and I'm not sure the $70 price difference between this and the 6-drawer would be worth it. It is definitely not worth dissembling and returning.What is also different is that while my other Prepac Sonoma products arrived in a timely fashion, this did not. Despite being Prime Eligible, it took 6 business days for shipping, which extended over 2 weekends.On the plus side, it still looks pretty sleek and the size is just what I was looking for.\",\n",

The Travelrest blanket is larger than most. It covered me comfortably from my trunk to my thighs. It kept me nice and warm for the duration of our 10+ hour flights.Unlike a few other reviewers, I did not have any problems folding the blanket back down to size and fitting it back into the storage pouch. it wasn't quite as neatly packed as the way it came from Travelrest, but it's certainly not overly bulky. It fit into my notebook bag without issues.The material is a soft fleece. No pills in the fabric after several uses--I'll update this review in the future to not how the blanket holds up over time.My three-year-old also loves this blanket. It's great for keeping in the car to throw over him while he rides in his car seat.

My cotton clothing looks good after ironing.  It does not get as hot as many irons that are out there.  If you need an iron with a high degree of heat, this is not the iron for you.  I actually like this better (someone else pointed this out in their review) since it makes it much more difficult to scorch what one is ironing.It's light in weight, the pointed back end of the iron makes for MUCH faster ironing, and I love that I can put the iron away in its case while it's still hot (the Japanese manual is much better than the one in English and makes it clear that the iron can be put into its case and stored while it is hot).I only use distilled water in the iron to avoid any calcification problems (we live in a fairly hard water area, but even if we didn't, I wouldn't want to take the risk of clogging up the steam vents over time).  I don't know if it's necessary, but I remove the water reservoir from the iron after I finish ironing.  Given the price per gallon of distilled water, I'd rather not dump the water out (per the instructions) when finished ironing.The bottom line is that this is an almost fun iron to use and it does a good job in getting the wrinkles out.\",\n",

They have chosen an unusual product line, which includes items like garbage cans, toilet plungers, soap dispensers, and of course the slim toilet brush.  Well, I guess somebody has to make them, and Simplehuman does a fabulous job.  Not only do they concentrate on making quality products but they have taken great strides in making these everyday items extremely stylish.  These products are things that you would expect to see in homes of the very wealthy, and yet the prices of their products are very affordable.  Still, some may hesitate spending $30 or more dollars on something as simple as a toilet brush.  Well folks, this is no ordinary toilet brush!I can't say enough about the looks of this brush set.  Brushed stainless steel and black have proven to make a stylish look in the kitchen, but who would have thought that this combination would make its way into your bathroom?  Well Simplehuman thought it was a great idea and I must agree.  This toilet brush is slim and sleek, from the easy to remove brush itself to the holder, which has a nice pivot-open door and removable tray (for easy cleaning).  The brush head is replaceable, which is a great feature, but you may have a hard time finding replacement heads.  I buy mine directly from the Simplehuman website, which sells them for $4.99 each.  Not a bad price at all.  If you prefer white instead of stainless steel, Simplehuman sells this same slim toilet brush in white as well.  The brush head has stiff outter bristles, for scrubbing tough stains, while the inner bristles are softer and fuller for regular cleaning.I have gone on and on about how great this toilet brush looks, and yet I only give it a 4-star rating.  Why is this?  Well, as stunning as this brush and holder look, using it is slightly less satisfying; at least at first.  Don't get me wrong, it works quite well, but it takes some getting used to.  As a previous reviewer pointed out, there is no rounded end to this brush, which is fairly custumary on most toilet brushes.  This makes it a little difficult to scrub way down into the drain opening of the toilet bowl.  Also, the brush is quite slim, so you will have to get used to holding the brush for proper scrubbing.  If you hold it wrong the brush will try to turn, which causes the handle to twist in your hand.  Still, after using this brush a few times you quickly learn how to get excellent results.  The stiff outer bristles are great for scrubbing under the rim of the toilet bowl, and the shape of the brush head is designed perfectly for this task.Overall I am very satisfied with my purchase of the Simplehuman Slim Toilet Brush, and I would definately buy it again.  If you are looking for a toilet brush that you won't have to hide away, and you are patient enough to allow yourself to get used to the unique shape and design of the curved brush head, then I would highly recommend this Simplehuman toilet brush.  It truly is the best looking brush and holder set on the market today.  The difficulty of using this brush to clean deep into the drain of the toilet bowl prevents me from giving this set a full 5 stars, but I certainly consider it a 4 and 1/2 star item.  And I can honestly tell you that Simplehuman's customer service staff are extremely friendly and will go the extra mile to make sure you are a satisfied customer.  Give the Simplehuman Slim Toilet Brush a home in your bathroom, and you are sure to receive a lot of compliments from others who visit your loo.  =o)\",\n",

       " 'B006WS39NE': {'Best review': \"I'm one of those people who really appreciates spending the extra money to own high quality tools, especially when I've experienced the frustration of using low quality ones.  In this case, I have many very clear memories of just how poorly various Dirt Devils and Black and Decker cordless vacuums have performed for me when I have used them.  I can remember actually just throwing one of them in the trash it was so useless, and repairing it (by installing a new battery) was (of course) going to be more expensive than getting a brand new one--which I wasn't going to do.  So, I swore off cordless vacuums entirely for many years, and personally only made the mistake of buying one once.  Until now, that is.  But I'm getting ahead of myself.So, my wife had expressed the desire to own a small cordless vacuum many times, so that she could just grab it to suck up dust bunnies and cat litter and what not between major vacuumings.  I refused to buy a dirt devil or black and decker, but then I read about the Dyson.  I knew the run-time vs. power trade off, and I knew that there was also obviously a price vs. performance trade-off, but I decided to give the DC34 a chance.  I bought mine at BB&B; for about what Amazon is selling it for (or a bit more).Well, very quickly I grew to dislike this thing.  First, I dislike bagless vacuums in general, but I set that aside for this small hand held.  Still, even being prepared for the downsides of bagless vacuums, this one goes beyond.  It INSTANTLY looks dirty and ugly.  Yeah, you see that nice, clear, fancy looking picture on the Amazon main page?  Forget it.  It will never look like that.  Not even if you try to clean it after every single use, because you can't get up very far inside the dirt container.  Or not easily.  And even if you do, it very quickly scratches anyway, so, well, it will always look dirty.  And, OK, that's not a huge deal, and it's certainly not a deal breaker.  Comes with the territory.  But be forewarned.More importantly, however, the design of this vacuum is seriously flawed.  The exhaust is small, concentrated, and in the wrong place and too close to the nozzle.  Perhaps if it were a bigger opening and were shooting upward things would be better.  As it is, however, it's so very very not good.  OK.  So picture this.  Ah, you see a dust bunny you want to vacuum up.  Excellent!  You just dropped some major coin on a fancy neat POWERFUL high tech handheld vacuum.  No problem.  You grab your DC34 and fire it up as you push the nozzle toward the soon-to-be-gone dust bunny.  But, much to your surprise, a whirlwind--a vortex--of crazy air grabs your prey and sends it erratically flying away!  It's INSANE!  Seriously.  You can not effectively vacuum up dust bunnies!  What is the freaking point of a handheld vacuum if it is frustrating to use for this basic task?  OK.  So, if you put the long crevice tool nozzle RIGHT NEXT To the dust bunny BEFORE pulling the trigger--and if you pulse the trigger--just a quick ON time then release--then you can reliably vacuum up that dust ball.  But otherwise?  Very hit or miss.Next, this thing is just kind of awkward.  It's tall.  It's heavy for it's size.  And it CAN'T BE TURNED ON ITS SIDE.  Or not very much.And despite various claims and raves about how powerful it is, it's really not that powerful.  I have found that in vacuuming up cat litter I need to use the crevice tool and need to get right on top of it before it gets pulled in.  This means lots of sweeping that stupid thing back and forth left and right.  And many missed little bits.  And for the record, I take very good care of my tools.  I have taken my DC34 apart and cleaned the cloth filter.It's just not good.  Period.  If it were $30 I'd probably give it three stars.  But at like five or six times that price?  What a joke.  And as for Dysons in general, talk to any vacuum repair person or shop and ask them what they think of Dysons.  At best they'll say that they're great for their repair side of the business.  My brother-in-law owns a cleaning business and he takes a VERY dim view of the bigger Dyson vacuums, which he found to be heavy, and not very good performers.Dyson spends an incredible amount of money on advertising.  That's the only reason they are such a well known name in vacuums.  You're much better of looking into Miele (for canisters), Sebo (for uprights), and Riccar.Don't.  Waste.  Your.  Money.\",\n",

I tried a plethora of settings; high heat, low heat, steam, no steam.  No heat, just that Frankenstien walk then squatting down.  When I turned the \"i-touch\" button off the iron heated quickly with boiling steam. I got a dime-sized burn on my stomach from a spurt of boiling water when I lifted the iron from horizontal to move it.I couldn\\'t get through on the Oliso customer service number.  When I sent them an e-mail explaining I was doing a review for Amazon.com and I needed a solution for the iron I got a call-back from Kevin.  After he guided me through all the settings again with no results, and suggesting Amazon had sent me a used iron, he gave me instructions for sending the iron in under warranty.I tracked the iron to Oliso in San Francisco (after it was miss-routed to Hayward, CA ) and it supposedly arrived there on Nov 6, 2013. I sent an e-mail asking if the iron had actually arrived..... No answer.Nov 14, 2013 I sent Kevin an e-mail asking the status of the case.....No answer.This iron has been on the market since at least 2009. If they don\\'t have the issues ironed out (sorry) by now they probably never will. Without the i-touch feature you just have a very heavy, expensive yellow iron.  If the landing gear deploys and won\\'t retract you just have a very expensive yellow door-stop.The iron has a year warranty; add three months if you register the iron. Big woop!  Judging from my experience consider this;  If the iron breaks down twice you lose about two months use of the iron.  At the present cost of $18.50 per trip, standard shipping, you have spent enough to buy another medium price iron from de longi, Panasonic , B&D;  or numerous other manufacturers.If you think you just have to have this iron my suggestion is keep another iron as back-up .If I get the iron back, or a working re-placement I will be back for an up-date of this review.UPDATE: Nov 30,2013. As promised I\\'m back to do an update. I received the first non-working-out-of-the box iron on Oct 27,2013. I got the replacement iron  on Nov 27.2013, one month and $18.50 shipping later. This iron seems to work very well for the moment. I like the long cord and the ball and socket swivel. The iron heats quickly and raises and lowers the way it\\'s supposed to. The settings are easy to read. After being burned by a spurt of boiling water from the first iron I\\'m a little leery of the steam but it seems to work alright. I guess the question is \"Are you feeling lucky?\". If you get a working iron, fine. If your iron doesn\\'t work and you have to deal with customer service you might be singing the blues.  Of course, there\\'s no guarantee how long the iron will last.',\n",

I liked it so much I decided to get one when my electric blanket died. Well, one side of the blanket died this year and I had my excuse. :-)I also have a programmable thermostat on my furnace and it's set to lower the temperature in the house to 55 overnight. I'm comfortably warn in my bed with the mattress pad set quite low (#1 on one side & #2 on the other) and just a sheet and light comforter over me. The sheet and comforter is the same way I sleep in summer so the mattress pad is supplying enough warmth to keep me comfortable in a 55 room. I turn it on a while before I go to bed and the bed is warmed enough to be comfortable and then warms up a bit more once I'm in bed.The mattress pad is comfortable to sleep on (I can't feel the wires at all) and I like the automatic 10-hour cut-off.

It also looked funny because I had to take the arms off the chair to get it to slide under my desk.  When I saw that this one had arms that flipped up and was not all leather AND was on a lightening deal I took a chance.The pros:  The chair looks expensive and the arms flip up so it can push in completely to a desk.The cons and I'll live with its:  I got the brown version and was slightly disappointed that only the mesh and leatherette portions were brown - all plastic parts are black or silver (frame the mesh attaches to is black.  Crossbars on the back are silver - this is my least favorite part since it stands out when you look at it from the back)).  But I will get used that that.It came with a scratch on the silver base but I happened to have a silver paint marker and a quick dab with that fixed it.It is nowhere near as comfortable as my previous chair.  The seat is rather firm and isn't comfortable to sit on for long periods of time.  Also it doesn't recline easily.  I loosened the tilt tension all the way and I can get it to recline a bit but only if I put my feet up on my desk and really push back.  Hoping that loosens up over time.Overall, it's an ok chair.  Since looking expensive and having flip up arms were my primary requirements I am keeping the chair - it knocked those two out of the park.  But I would have really liked to have the chair be more comfortable for the price I paid.\",\n",

No odor when it is new -- unlike plastic curtains.3. The creases from where it was folded are still there a month later - even though I have intentionally aimed the hot shower stream on them. Hope these come out when it is laundered.4. There are only two magnets - one in each of the bottom corners. Be sure they are attached where you want them - the natural tendency of the curtain seems to leave a space at the edge. As long as side edges and magnets are positioned properly, the curtain does its job.5. There is a minimum of billowing. Hardly any. Don\\'t know why, but this curtain does not crowd into the shower space. Maybe the airy open weave of the see-through panel fabric changes the air-flow?6. Unlike fabric of natural fibers, this nylon one does not absorb water, so dries quickly if you just give it a quick shake at the end of your shower.UPDATE: June 7, 2010 -- Original review at one month, this update at six: Still love it, still looks like new -- even the creases have hardly hung out. No mold, no rips or tears.UPDATE: March 2, 2011 -- After a year I finally began to see mold spots along the bottom. Ran it through a hot bleach load with sheets and towels -- the mold is gone and the off-white creamy color is still a perfect match for the walls.

I had been wanting to try a memory foam pillow ever since I got the bed so, when I saw this pillow advertised as a memory foam pillow, I ordered it.My first error was that I apparently did not read the product description fully, because this is not at ALL what I expected.  Most memory foam pillows are quite slim, but this one is HUGE and doesn\\'t feel at all like a memory foam pillow.  I guess the difference is that this pillow has memory foam at its core but is, in fact, a regular pillow AROUND a foam core, so you don\\'t feel the foam at all (after much use, when the regular pillow stuffing gets flatter, you would probably feel it, but definitely not when it is new).The pillow is very nice looking and seems very well made, so even though it wasn\\'t what I had expected, I looked forward to trying it.  Well...the first night didn\\'t go so well.  I don\\'t think I made it 5 minutes before I had to throw it off the bed and revert to my old pillow.  I am a side sleeper with a very short neck and this pillow is 5-6\" high.  I just could not get comfortable enough to go to sleep using this pillow.  The next night, I fared better and got to sleep but think I ended up switching back to my old pillow during the night.  I kept trying it, and it kept ending up on the floor, so I moved it back to my combination guest room/office.  I take naps there some days, so I have continued to use it off and on; it seems to work better for a short nap than for a full night\\'s sleep--for me at least.Bottom Line:  If you like a high, firm pillow or have a long neck, this may work great for you.  If you prefer a slimmer pillow and/or are a side sleeper like me, this may not be the best pillow for you.  I suspect that, once I am able to use the pillow enough that the batting around the memory core compresses, it could be a very comfortable pillow.  As of now, though, it is still relegated to the guest bed.Note:  Some reviews commented that this pillow would not fit their regular pillowcases.  I happened to have a set of new pillowcases still in the package that I was going to use for a craft project and they fit this pillow (just barely), so I didn\\'t personally have a problem with that.  It\\'s possible that if I tried to use the pillow with one of my old pillowcases, this might not be the case.',\n",

First, we had to purchase the &#34;Structures by Malouf Set of 2 Footboard Extenstion Brackets&#34; kit because our frame wasn't long enough. The installation was tricky, but mostly because I wasn't sure what I was doing.If I can help just one person with the following....My advide would be to attach the brackets to the head/foot board FIRST, then line up your entire assembled bed frame so that you can see excatly where the screws/holes will line up. The way I did it incorrectly the first time was to attach the brackets to the just the left-side of the bed frame first, attached it to the left-side of the head board, and then did the right side. Next, I tried to assembele the bed frame, but it was too wide with the direction I had the brackets so I had to undo everything and start over. Don't be like me....Overall, they are well constructed and worked perfectly for us. If you found this review helpful, please click YES so that others can find it more easily.\",\n",

       " 'B00009RAVL': {'Best review': \"My wife and I have been using this fan in our bedroom now for the past week.  I honestly don't understand the complaints from other reviewers about this fan being noisy.  We find this fan to be quieter than any other stand fan that we have ever owned (and we have owned many).  I do have a theory about what may be causing the noise they are complaining about (explained below).The fan arrived from Amazon in just a few days.  The box arrived without a scratch and upon inspection I found no damage to any of the contents.  The asssembly instructions are a little confusing but it is honestly easy to figure out without any instructions.  Six screws and washers attach the round, weighted base to the middle control section.  Some have complained about the screw holes not aligning properly.  Well I found that I had to have my wife hold the control module pole while I gently twisted the round base, at the same time that I installed the mounting screws.  This allowed the screws to be installed without problem.  Two small screws attach the fan motor housing to the extension pole coming from the top of the middle control section.  The fan blade goes on easily.  The only real challange I had was attaching the fan safety cage, which requires a gentle yet firm touch to snap the two halves together while making sure everything is lined up properly.  It was after I had everything installed and the fan plugged in that I noticed that there was a layer of protective plastic over the Soleus badge plate in the center of the front fan safety cage.  I pulled the plastic off and everything was ready to go (or so I thought).I turned the fan on and played around with all of the settings.  The fan worked extremly well and seemed very quiet, even at the highest speed setting.  However, when we turned the fan on low, to run overnight while we slept, I noticed a little noise.  It just sounded like the typical noise of the fan blades moving air.  As I listened the noise seemed to get louder and softer without any sort of pattern.  I shut the fan off and turned on the light.  I ended up pulling the front of the safety cage off and it was at that moment that I noticed some protective plastic on the inside of the front safety cage, on the backside of the Soleus badge plate.  If you remember, I mentioned that I had pulled some plastic off the front of this badge plate but obviously the plastic was wrapped around the entire plate.  I just didn't notice that when I was assembling the safety cage.  It was a little challanging but I was able to remove all of the plastic from the backside of that plate.After re-attaching the front section of the safety cage, I turned the fan on low and listened carefully.  The strange noise was gone and the fan has remained extremely quiet ever since.  Although most of the components of this fan are made of plastic, it has a fairly solid feel.  It looks very high tech and attractive.  We love the adjustment abilities of the motor/fan head.  Be advised, the platinum (silver) colored plastic on the base and control module scratch very easily.  I put a fairly large scratch across the top surface of the round base by accident and it looks quite ugly.  However, it is in our bedroom and nobody will see it anyway.  Overall my wife and I would highly recommend the Soleus Air FSH-40G remote controlled stand fan to anyone looking for a quiet, stylish looking stand fan that has wonderful features, including an easy to use remote control.  It is easy to assemble, moves a lot of air with very little noise, has just about any feature that you could ever want from a fan, and it seems to be built with quality components that should last for many years.  The cost of this fan is not cheap but I feel that approximately $50 for a fan of this quality and performance is well worth the money we paid.  =o)\",\n",

I'm not adamantly opposed to the use of chemicals, but the fact that this product works so well completely with steam is wonderful and certainly a plus for me. The steam's pressure and temperature seems great, and I could notice a stark difference after cleaning my apartment and upholstery furniture.My only big complaint is that the unit has a lot of down time overall between heating up and repressurizing and can't be refilled safely until cooled down. I hear the Ladybug line is better if you want to mitigate that problem and price is not an issue, but they're much more expensive for not profoundly better cleaning. Once this heats up, it'll give plenty of high-pressure steam to clean hundreds of square feet (minus very brief intervals occasionally while it repressurizes during use), so it's perfect for apartments and smaller homes and would really do fine for anyone as long as they can be patient. Just keep in mind that initial boiling and cooldown adds an hour or so of dead time to each tank's use, so if you're going to do a lot of steaming, be prepared to have other things to keep you occupied.Also, it includes a nice little compartment for various attachments to be stored, which is a nice little touch that I wish more cleaning tech had.\",\n",

It may have to do with this particular unit - one of the nozzles is temperamental - it mists in random times and decides to go to sleep more often than not. The grounded GFCI plug makes this a safe option (obviously, ensure you have an appropriate outlet and easy access to connecting a garden hose to prevent kids from tripping over). The cheap-looking construction and the inconsistent nozzle performance makes it difficult an enthusiastic recommendation.

We keep the heater in our large master bedroom, which is about 340 square feet. It does a great job heating up the bedroom before we go to bed. It takes about 35 minutes to raise the temperature in the bedroom about 10-degrees. This has allowed us to lower the thermostat on the whole house furnace at night which saves energy.THe Lasko has several features that work together to provide excellent performance. It uses a fan to circulate the heated air throughout the room and it this allows for even warmth all over a large room. The Lasko only becomes slightly warm to the touch on the outside surface which makes it a good choice for rooms with kids and pets. I have owned other electric heaters that get hot and can burn young fingers. Another great feature is the excellent digital thermostat which I have found to be very accurate. At a glance you can read the room temperature which is shown in a clear red LED display. You can set the temperature you want and the heater will automatically shut off when it reaches the desired temperature. It will come back on when the room temperature drops below your set point making it ideal for use all night. Once the room has reached our desired temperature of 68-degreees I will reset the thermostat for 64-degrees before retiring for the evening.  This allows us to save energy during the night but sleep well knowing the heater will turn on if it gets really cold in the bedroom.I would have rated the Lasko 5-stars but subtracted one star for noise. The unit does make some noise when operating so we have it placed 14-feet away from the bed. At this distance the noise is diminished but it may disturb you if you are a very light sleeper.',\n",

       " 'B007QZ8NII': {'Best review': 'Year 3 update: QUALITY CHANGE ALLERT!Although my soleus KY-80 is still working fine, I have a feeling that the quality of the unit has changed since 2012. There are MANY 2014 reviews that talk about a grinding noise, leaking, and the AC function stopping because the self evaporation feature is not working. This causes the small collection tray at to bottom of the unit to fill up and have to be manually drained. I have a feeling that there is an internal pump that is defective, so the water just accumulates in the drip pan...which only holds about 2 cups. I had this issue with my old Whytner. Although it is easily remedied by elevating the unit and placing a bucket underneath, this is NOT how a fully functional PAC should work under all but extreme humidity conditions. I think Soleus has been either been shipping defective units, or has re-designed their 8000 btu models to save themselves money. So keep this in mind while reading the original reviews below:=======================================================================================================Year 2 update:1)We\\'ve had to use the Soleus for the last few days because the central system in our bldg was not up and running. The effctiveness of PACs (including this one)seems to depend on the ambient and outdoor temps and the amount of humidity. If the outdoor air is humid (>70%), but the temp is not that hot (less than 80*), don\\'t expect the unit to lower the room temp more than a couple degrees beyond what it achieves the first half hour of operation. As another reviewer explained, single hose PACs have an in-efficiency issue(cooled room air is being taken in to the unit via the side of the machine instead of a second intake duct) BUT...the comfort level of having the humidity decreased (by 4-8%)can maker a bigger difference than having the temp lowered by a few additional degrees. Therefore, I\\'m still happy with the Soleus, which is actually more effective at taking moisture out of the air than the bldg\\'s central system. BTW...Unless something is wrong with my unit, the only difference between the AC and Dehumidiy modes is that the latter does not have a thermostat/temp control...the cold air output is the same.2)I have not been constantly draining the condensation into a bucket like I had to do with my first PAC and have had no leakage problems. I recently found the point that the machine cries \"uncle\" with automatic shut-off, though. Our building\\'s central air fizzed in the middle of a(very humid) night...we woke up to a reading of 96% (yech) on the humidistat. I turned on the the KY-80 and it had the humidity down to 84% in 2 hours before shutting off. I shut off the machine, drained the water into a bucket, turned the AC back on. It got the humidity down to 68% over the next 3 hours and has been fine since...no shut-off.3)I have taken another reviewer\\'s suggestion and duct-taped AC filter replacement material (available on Amazon or any hardware store)over the lower intake vents to help keep the coils cleaner (there are 2 removeable/cleanable filters on the upper vents).Below is the original review from last year:====================================================================================================================This is my 2nd Portable AC...I wrote an extensive review about the first one I bought in 2006 that goes into details about the problems with all PAC\\'s...so understand that my first experience set the bar pretty low. Also,the reason we own a PAC is to supplement the building\\'s central air system that has a way of breaking down on hot, humid weekends, so it is not used as our primary cooling device but just in emergency situations to cool our 180 sq ft bedroom. During the hot spell last week when the central system went kaput, the old Whytner was making funny noises and overheating so we threw it out...here is a link to that review if you want to read it:http://www.amazon.com/10000-Portable-Conditioner-ARC-10D-Whynter/product-reviews/B000KLSRP4/ref=dp_top_cm_cr_acr_txt?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints;=1So far, the Soleus KY-80 that we bought as a replacement is a big improvement even though it has 2000 fewer BTUs:1)The foot print of this model is wonderful: a small unit for a small room. I would rather have a dual hose model...they are much more efficient, but we just don\\'t have the space. Also, it has good design elements that make it easier to put it together and take it apart quickly for easy storage if you are not using it on a regular basis. Even something as simple as a cord winder is a big help. The two way leuvers are good...keep the verticle ones facing up! My only minor concern is that there is no removable filter on the lower half of the unit.2)The set up was quick and easy BUT I am using a home-made window kit that was put together by cutting a hole for the hose in a piece of hi-density foam rubber (from an old leg pillow) that slides in and out of the window easily and insulates better without duct tape. The biggest complaints about this and other larger, more expensive units are the cheesy window kits...easily resolved by putting together your own. Also...before powering on the unit, make sure it is in an upright position for a few hours! I ran across this suggestion from other PAC reviewers. This gives the refrigerant a chance to settle if the unit was shipped upside down or sideways.3)The day it arrived, the ambient temp was only 75d and relatively low humidity...no real need for AC, but I did want to make sure the unit worked. It sure did. In 30 minutes, it lowered the temp from 75 to 72d and the humidity from 46% to 43%. In contrast, I put on the central unit(its working again) in the other bedroom as a basis for comparison and it got the temp down to 73d in the same time frame, so the Soleus did better than the central system. As with my old unit, I slipped a fiberglass insulating sleeve over the duct hose...this is a big help for all PACs because they can generate enough heat to nulify the cooling.4)The other major complaint about PAs is the \\'self evaporative\\' feature that tends not to work...see my old review for details. I can\\'t comment on this because the humidity level today is not challenging, but I am fully prepared to elevate the unit onto a platform (I use an old desk top computer on its side) and drain it into a bucket if necessary...that\\'s just the nature of the beast. Also, the higher the unit is elevated, the more effective the cooling will be since cool air falls/hot air rises. Again, the fact that the unit weighs only 50 lbs helps!5)The noise level of the Soleus KY-80 is darned acceptable...much quieter than the old Whytner, and certainly no noiser than the larger window units that some of my friends have in their apts. You have to realize that there is a motor and a compressor that are IN the room...not hanging out the window (like window units)or outdoors or in a basement (like central systems).6)The price is certainly right...but my concern is longevity. The old PAC lasted 6 years but it was only used perhaps 10 nights a year. If this one does as well, for the price, I\\'ll be satisfied.The 5 stars (so far) are based on an apples to apples comparison: There is no way that the BTUs of a single hose portable are going to equal those of a window unit, or the ambient cooling is going to be equal to that of a central system. But having said that, so far, this little unit works quite well.Update: This past weekend our bldg\\'s central air went out...it was VERY humid even tho the temp inside was only 79d, the humidity was 62%. I set the unit up in the living room to see what would happen even though the area is at least 700 sq ft. The unit reduced the temp by 2 degrees...which is amazing considering the size of the room, but it reduced the humidity by 9%...down to 53%. The room was quite comfortable. Fortunately, that evening the central was working again, and I had the Soleus disconnected, drained, and back in the closet in fewer than 15 minutes.',\n",

It is not easy to find an affordable duvet cover that is 100% cotton and looks THAT nice. And to top it off, the price was pretty decent. It wasn't the highest quality fabric, but I didn't really sleep on it. It just made my bed look pretty like a pair of really high heels. Unfortunately, laundry day comes and I wash it according to the instructions on the tag: with cold water, on the gentle cycle, no bleach, blah, blah, blah. At the end of the cycle when I take of the duvet cover I see that the white part (background) seems to have a grayish color cast. I washed again with detergent and some baking soda and white distilled vinegar and it looked slightly better but still gray. I also bought the matching shower curtain for my bathroom and the exact same thing happened to it when I washed it. I did the rest of my laundry with no issues that day, so there is something seriously wrong with the fabric they use to make those curtains and blankets. I am extremely disappointed because I loved my duvet cover and curtain so much and now they are trash. I expected at least decent quality from Perry Ellis. I will never waste my money on anything from that brand in the future.\",\n",

As I live in Hawaii I have lots of visitors -- I didn't want my parents having to sleep on a very uncomfortable sofa sleeper, or give up my bed so they could sleep on it and I sleep on the sofa. I purchased this for about $150 with Prime, shipping to Hawaii arrived in about a week (standard for Prime in Hawaii). Box was very small for the mattress size, and easy for me to carry. Opened up the box on the sofa sleeper frame and cut open the plastic. The mattress began to unfold and expand within minutes, however it did take about 8 hours for it to fully open to just under 4&#34; tall. With the old mattress i could feel every bar under it and was horribly uncomfortable to just lay there for a couple of minutes. The first night I thought I would try out the new mattress. I laid on it to watch tv and honestly could not feel the bars under the mattress at all.I recently had my first guests over for a week and they both said that the bed was very comfortable, and didn't feel like it was a sofa sleeper at all.We did notice that you will want to pull the sofa sleeper out about an hour before bed if possible to allow for it to come back to full thickness.\",\n",

I\\'ve had pretzels at least a month after the bag was originally opened (but within the \"best by\" date), and they snapped with a delightful crunch and had a fresh taste like they were just opened.FYI, if these are a tad too large for your uses, just trim them to fit (they\\'re a bit on the big size for many bags).',\n",

After the target humidity level is reached, the unit shuts off and turns back on later when the humidity level drops.Refilling the tanks can be a challenge.  We use either the kitchen sink or the laundry room sink because our bathroom faucets are too low to fill the tanks effectively.  You need enough clearance to get the tank under the faucet while allowing the tank to stay level.  It also helps to have a counter or other level surface to rest the tank on while refilling.  It took me a few tries to master properly inserting the water tanks back in the humidifier.  If you do not insert the tanks correctly, the water will not flow from the tank.

The way the bolts are positioned, it is tricky to get your fingers in there and fasten it securely.If I were to do it all over again; I would purchase a head/footboared that went straight across and didn't have the curved corners - unless I had the room to accomodate that extra space.\",\n",

I actually prefer the manual controls- fewer electronics to go wrong and one less remote to lose- low power start-up to save money and will reset to the preset setting after a power outage (common around here). This is important since the room will not be occupied every day.The AC cools quickly and can be set to re-circulate the indoor air or with outside air intake. 56 DBA rating so it is  quiet if properly installed . Easy access to the antibacterial filter which can be either  washed or vacuumed . Adjustable louvers.One thing I should warn you about if you're only familiar with the usual one-room window units . This unit is HEAVY. I would estimate around 70 pounds so it will probably take two people to install it.Made in China, of course, but with one year warranty.\",\n",

I did hate the assembly of these pieces but once finished, I was & am entirely pleased with my purchases. I intend to buy one more as soon as amazon has the stock.12/24/12 UPDATE:Having been so satisfied with my initial purchases of winsome wood shelving, all of which has caused me no concern and still look nicely finished & sturdy to this date, I found myself in need of more shelves and so I came back to amazon. Despite purchasing my new winsome wood shelving from the same amazon listing... a very different product arrived in a box bearing the same name. the first thing I noticed, even before opening the box, is the surprising light weight. after opening the box, I was struck by the pale finish, assuming you can even call it that. though my current & former shelves were both also listed as having a \"natural\" finish, the new shelves suffered a carelessly applied varnish (by careless I mean they did not fully varnish it, spots were left untreated). these new shelves arrived almost free of any natural wood grain pattern & in a colorless form reminiscent of an impoverished victorian-era coffin. to be honest, an old pine burial box probably would have looked nicer then the shelves I received today...  On the the quality of construction, in the previous shelves, you can see patterns cut into the wood similar to, but not exactly like the dovetailed joints of well-constructed wood pieces, these joints previously made for a more interesting finish and an over-all sturdier product. in the shelves I just recieved, all of the former jointing is GONE and the previously \"stackable\" shelf has become noticeably & frighteningly flimsy. even the wood itself is now far softer and more susceptible to early damage caused by general assembly & predicably by general use. while the last shelves were more difficult to assemble due to the hardness of the wood, the wood is now butter-soft. assembly was easy but I feel ripped-off and cheated on the quality. the shelves I purchased were $59.00 each... but heirloom quality, the shelves that arrived at my door aren\\'t worth a very generous $40.00, with the additional knowledge that they might not last more then 1 or 2 years.during the past year or 2, the production of these winsome wood shelves went from proud pieces to its more current form of functional trash. now, I\\'m very upset because I have a small apartment & I really NEED shelves but these pieces of s*** aren\\'t worth the price I paid.

       " 'B0009HALCQ': {'Best review': 'Well, I\\'m not sure what to think. I\\'ve purchased other reconditioned items before and been completely satisfied with how they arrived. This package came to me with a large hole/tear in the box and no packing materials. The front of the vacuum looked worn. I would not go as far to say that it had \"other people\\'s dirt\" in it like another reviewer, but it was obviously used, though it appeared to have a new cord, roller and accessories. The vacuum was seemingly unbroken after its journey in the holey box, so I assembled the handle and read the instructions before firing it up.We bought this to replace an older (circa 1996) Hoover Windtunnel with bags which had begun emitting burning odors and got very hot during operation. The suction was still good, but it was really time to retire it. The Y bags on the old Windtunnel always seemed rather small, had to be replaced frequently and seemed to be going up in price. I had been wanting a bagless vacuum for several years. Being satisfied with my previous Hoover and with a price under $50 we decided to go ahead and order this despite the mixed reviews here.It is very similar in appearance to my old Hoover. As others have mentioned, this reconditioned model is missing the \"dirt sensor\" feature. Annoying, but I was expecting that already. This has a few additional features like a powered hand tool for cleaning stairs, etc. I was not particularly impressed by this attachment, and the attachment hose itself is not very long or substantial. The vacuum power of the hose is somewhat inadequate. With my previous Windtunnel, when I would use the extension hose it would have full power while in use and suction would stop at the floor level. This is not designed that way and has a much weaker suction. The vac itself is rather heavy and kind of loud, but again, I was not surprised by this, since this is the nature of this product.Pro: The dirt chamber is easy to remove and put in, unlike other models I had looked at. It works very well and sucked up an unbelievable amount of dog/cat hair and dust. However, the small chamber filled up very quickly. The HEPA filter was positively choked with dust. This filter is located in the adjacent narrow chamber. The instructions indicate to tap the chamber against a garbage can to loosen all the dust. Probably more than half of it stuck onto the filter and in the recessed areas around it. I can see that this filter is probably going to have to be cleaned/replaced fairly quickly. The necessity to stop and dump the canister frequently caused dust to go everywhere. My hands were filthy. I felt like I had to take a shower after using it, not to mention my sinuses started to clog. I am beginning to wish I had gotten a non-bagless model...So, I have mixed feelings. On one hand, this is an unbelievable price for a Hoover Windtunnel. It appears to be in fine working order. However, the dust chamber to me seems quite small compared to other models I looked at, and I don\\'t care for the filter location and crevices around the filter which collect dust. (I\\'m not speaking of the pleats on the filter itself, but the locking mechanism that holds it in). This may be a caveat that these type of bagless vacs have, since this is my first experience with owning one. I have heard that these filters can get clogged, but it seemed kind of extreme to me.So, I am really not sure whether I would recommend it. At $50, it may be worthwhile as a second vac or to see if you like a bagless. I\\'m not sure that I do after this experience.',\n",

Compared to a normal Vornado whole room circulator, I\\'d say it does maybe half the actual air volume (at least it feels that way).The other problem with the fan is that you can only feel the air from a very specific point.

       " 'B001DEXA86': {'Best review': 'I have had this since 2004, and it was purchased based on Bissell\\'s claim that it out cleans its competition...The ProHeat had features that were very attractive like an on-board heater, 12-amp heavy duty motor, 3 settings for the carpet cleaner dispenser, long handeld cleaner hose, and powerful suction. These were features that the more expensive competitors had, or didn\\'t have. We chose the ProHeat based on the price (it was nearly $100 cheaper than the Hoover) and the features.My first impressions on the cleaning power were mixed. It cleaned pretty good, about as good as the competiton and maybe a little better, but that was the only area that the ProHeat stood-out. It was relatively quiet when running as well. To use it, you need to fill the water tank, which is pretty easy. To get it out of the machine, you need to lower the machine\\'s handle all the way, raise the tank\\'s convenient carry handle and lift it out. It has a locking mechanism that keeps the cover on. To fill it, you push the tank\\'s handle all the way forward to lift the lid off, and pour in hot water (ideally, the hotter the better, but below boiling or semi-boiling because it will melt the bladder). Put the lid back on (it only goes on one way which I liked, no fiddling required), raise the carry handle, and set it back in the machine. Push the handle down back where it goes, and raise the machine\\'s handle and that\\'s it! Simple.The cleaning solution tank is also easy to fill. Just pull it out of the receptacle on the machine, making sure the dispensing end is tipped upright, then unscrew the base, pour in the solution, keeping it upright, and then set it back in the receptacle.To start it, you need to turn on the main power switch, then the heater switch. The heater won\\'t turn on independently. You have to have the main switch on first which is a mystery to me. Bissell says to let it run for a few minutes before using so the heater gets warmed up. You have a valve on the left side that switches between the floor cleaning mode and the handheld tool, which I also liked. There\\'s also a three-position switch for dispensing cleaning solution. The normal setting is for routine cleaning, the heavy setting dispenses the most solution to clean high-traffic or very dirty areas, and there\\'s also a water/pre-treatment setting that dispenses water for rinsing or a pre-treating chemical like Scotch Guard or spot remover.Cleaning is pretty simple, just push the trigger and let the machine do its thing. I wasn\\'t surprised or stunned at the cleaning power at all. It did what I asked it to and not much more. It did perform admirably and cleaned up all that I asked it to, including some set-in stains from juice, soda, and food like soup or stew. It even cleaned up pet \"stains\" and formula used for enteral tube-feeding, which is difficult to clean, and hardens into a glue-like gunk when dried. After pre-treating it, the Bissell took care of it. It did take a while, but eventually got it out. I did use it to clean a big hot chocolate spill that sat overnight in pre-treatment, and it did good, but didn\\'t really get all of it. I cleaned it for about 15 minutes too using the heavy solution setting.The handheld tool didn\\'t work very good. It does dispense water and cleaner, but never really sealed to the handle properly and air leaked out so it lost a good deal of suction. All it was really good for was scrubbing and pre-treating a tough stain. I used it to clean the back of my station wagon and was sort of disappointed because it didn\\'t get out all the dirt. They weren\\'t bad stains either and I soaked them in cleaner beforehand. I also used it to clean up the aforementioned hot chocolate spill without much effect. The hose was nice and long though!I am suspect of the \"heat\" part of ProHeat. I wasn\\'t impressed with how hot it got the cleaning water. I barely noticed any steam at all from it even on a cool day. Even when I filled the tank with hot water, it still wasn\\'t hot. Maybe mine was defective? Still, it should work as advertised.There are other problem areas as well. The plastic parts used to hold the hand tool in place are flimsy and broke after three months. Now the wand doesn\\'t stay in place and there\\'s really nowhere to stow it. Furthermore, this thing is heavy! It weighs about 30 pounds and besides being heavy it is very cumbersome and a bear to carry up stairs. I am a strong guy and I found myself man-handling it on occasion. The wheels are nice and big though, so it goes over thresholds good.The other area is leaking. The machine leaks if you set it sit in one place while running. The water tank also leaks out of the bottom when you take it off. Emptying the waste tank isn\\'t too bad. The water storage tank is actually two tanks in one. The inner bladder is for the clean water, which empties quickly, and there\\'s a separate storage for the wastewater, which isn\\'t very big and fills quickly. It empties out of the back of the tank, but I wished it held more like the machines you rent. The total storage is about 1-1/2 gallons, maybe less. It also has a removable little plastic mesh filter that picks up everything but the smallest dirt particles, and it gets dirty fast, but cleaning it is easy. Cleaning the rest of the machine is also pretty easy.The cleaning solution tank is also too small. It only lasted for 10 or so minutes of constant cleaning on the highest solution dispension setting. It also leaked when I took it out to fill it.Pros:Cleans carpets goodMotor is relatively quietThree settings for cleaning solution dispensingSelectable floor/tool functionLong cleaning wand hoseBig wheels make it easy to pushBuilt-in filter is easy to cleanCons:LeaksWater and cleaning solution tanks too smallHeater didn\\'t work very goodHand tool was almost uselessFlimsy plastic tool holder broke easilySo that\\'s the Bissell ProHeat. It\\'s a no-frills carpet cleaner that will do what you ask it to, but not much more. There are some bright spots, but the bad areas are enough to turn me off to it. There are better machines out there that cost more, but will be worth it.',\n",

It felt softer than the memory foam and my head sunk down more, so was not as good as the memory foam version for me. And, it seemed much smaller since the Malouf memory foam sticks out the end of the pillowcase and the LinenSpa has almost a foot to spare when I shake it down into the pillowcase.  However, my son liked this pillow waaaaayyyy better than his almost flat down pillow and does not like memory foam, so he took it, and loves it. In  the meantime, my wife stole my high loft memory foam since she loved that, so I ended getting yet another Malouf zoned memory foam pillow.

Amazon.com ... 5*]**UPDATED**:  Final \"hepa\" filter is supposed to trap the finest particles. The original filter snaps shut tightly so there is no leakage. Not so in this imitation.  The oblong filter just fits and pops out easily. I tested by applying pressure on each end (top then bottom) of the filter alternate to see if the other end pops out. It does.  And with it the fine dust particles which it is supposed to trap falls out in a puff of cloud.  In 4 yrs I have not sneezed with the Hoover WindTunnel. Hv done so at least a dozen time since and an old dust allergy has been manifesting the last 2 days.**Update: old dust allergy has resurfaced for 3 weeks now.Disappointed. Not fit for purpose \"as is\". To use this, some modification is required to rectify - you have to duct tape around the filter to seal it into position on the hoover to prevent the dust leak. Use a heavy duct tape. I decided to try it out yesterday, and it appears to work through the 2.5 hours of vacuuming at two different locations.Note also, this item is not (exactly) as shown on Amazon. Instead of two equal columns of hepa fan filter, the version I received has an additional \"third\" 1cm column along the middle of the panel apart from that the design looks similar Material used & finish differs. Filter material seem less robust than original though the third column may well reinforce it structurally to compensate.Came as loose unpackaged items. In fact all items purchased on this order were loose & unpackaged.  If you live in the US and get free postage, then take your chance - perhaps it is a case of getting what you pay for.

The workmanship appears good: the hinges are assisted by helping brackets...and I did not find the mild scent [inside or out] objectionable.

The top provides a firm, pliable support for sitting.Only two caveats:a) opening the top requires the ottoman to be pulled away from whatever it is against by a few inches...just in case that might be important to some customers.b) Amazon shipped this via \"FedX Home Delivery\"...which was very fast [overnight, even on a weekend] but they left my order out in the rain without any cover, allowing it to be soaked by a heavy rain.

I plan to buy a second one for the other shower and am even considering a third to go in front of the bathroom sink because it feels that good.\",\n",

The colors have remained bright and vibrant.  The anti-mildew agent they put on it really does help keep the mildew down.  I also like the little suction cups on the lower part of each side.  You can stick them to the sides of your shower to help keep it in place.  Very handy feature.Drawbacks:The only bad thing is that this curtain doesn't have reinforced ring-holes so they will tear after a while.  But I knew that when I bought this so I can't complain too much.  You get what you pay for, that's what I always say.  If you want reinforced holes you'll have to pay a little more.Overall this has been a good shower curtain.  I only spent about $10 on it, and it has already lasted a year.\",\n",

       " 'B00B75QDQC': {'Best review': \"[LAST EDIT: I bought 4 70 pint Hisense units and all were defective.  Then I bought a 70 pint GE dehumidifier from another box store. That was also defective. The Amazon price on the 70 pint Frigidaire finally dropped back (eighty dollar drop!) to the normal price and I bought it (not from a 3rd party).  The Frigidaire is working perfectly and I have to empty it 3 times a day.]Well, it's that awful time of the year again.  Very humid and the outdoor temperature is between 60 and 70 degrees.  Too cool to turn on the air conditioner and too warm to turn on the heat(the house will become a virtual sauna).The house gets an odor from what I can only assume is mildew, which appears during only this damp weather.  When we step into the house after being gone for a few house, we can smell it (and we don't have any pets, carpets or kids -- and the sofas are leather).  No matter how clean I keep the house, the house smells during this odd cool but damp season.  The wood floors are cupped from the moisture.Yesterday we went to a big box store to pick up some small items.  I thought, maybe we should break down and buy a dehumidifier while we're here.  We had a choice of one brand, one size - the new reality:  The Hisense DH-70K1SJE.  We bought it.[EDIT:The review below was for the first unit I bought. The unit had so many problems, I'm not going to list them all.  I brought the dehumidifier back the next day and exchanged it for a new unit.  The new unit (after 24 hours) is working perfectly.  The relative humidity digital readout now consistently matches my hygrometer (the 1st unit starting reporting RH levels of random numbers).The RH of my 2000 sqft house is now down to 47% (30% to 50% RH for the interior of a house is considered ideal).END EDIT]I was able to set it up and had it running without having to read the manual.  When I turned it on, the noise was not unpleasant (my previous dehumidifier from many years ago, a Magic Chef,  made an horrible racket -- I truly hated having to turn it on).  The sound of this one is even, with no strange high pitched noises emanating from the motor.It's running right now about 15 feet from me and I'm quite content with the sound level.  It's actually a great white noise generator. I should mention that I have very good hearing and I'm very sensitive to noises.When I first turned the dehumidifier on, the relative humidity registered 63 percent which matched my hygrometer.  As I'm running the dehumidifier, I hear dripping sounds like a small waterfall.  After running the dehumidifier for just a few hours, the humidity dropped from 63 percent to 55.I should point out that my house is an open environment -- very few doors and two stories so I'm dehumidifying the whole house.  After a few more hours, the bucket was already full.Note: Removing the bucket is a nuisance.  The designers were just too clever for themselves.  There's no grip or handle to remove the bucket -- you have to pry it out with your fingernails.  And mind you, when the bucket is full, the bucket is heavy and not terribly easy to remove.I succeeded in removing the bucket and for the first time, I checked out the bucket handle.  It's lightweight plastic like a toy and looks and feels like the handle would snap right off when the bucket is heavy with water.  I carry the bucket from the bottom with two hands and drain it into the sink.  I use the handle only to carry the empty bucket back to reinstall.After running the dehumidifier for another few hours, the humidity is down to 43 percent but the temperature of the first floor rose from 72 to 77 degrees. It's getting a bit toasty but not disagreeable.Using a small flashlight that I keep nearby, I can see the water level in the bucket window (tinted dark blue for aesthetic reasons but another minor nuisance for the user).Pros:*  Noise is not unpleasant but wouldn't be suitable while watching TV, radio or having a normal conversation*  Water removal rate is very fast*  Humidity level is displayed in a digital readout and can be set in 5 degree increments*  The device can be pushed up against a wall since the air intake is located on the front, and the dry air is exhausted on the right side*  Device is fairly attractive*  The device has rollers (non-locking) and is easy to move around*  There's a window on the front of the bucket so that you can see the water level but the dark blue plastic makes it difficult to see without using a flashlight (or the room is very bright)*  The dehumidifier weight isn't too heavy. Meaning that even though I'm quite small, I can still pick it up.  My old dehumidifier was a bear to pick up, and I was a lot younger and stronger at that time.  The unit's light weight is due to the thin lightweight plastic.*  You don't need to read the manual to initially get the dehumidifier up and running. I turned it on and set the humidity level down to 40 percentCons:* The top handle is suitable only for gliding the dehumidifier around on a floor but way too flimsy to pick it up* The bucket handle is too lightweight for carrying a full bucket -- I suspect that the handle would snap off almost immediately, creating a mini-flood* There's a window on the front of the bucket so that you can see the water level but the dark blue plastic makes it difficult to see without using a flashlight (or the room is very bright)* Removing the bucket is a bit of a nuisance. It becomes increasing more annoying each time I need to empty the bucket.  It's starting to grate on my nerves.  The bucket needs a front handle or at least indentations on the sides of the bucket for one's  fingers.  What were they thinking when they designed it?  Were the designers kids fresh out of product design school?  One star off for this design flaw.Hmmm, as I'm writing this, the unit briefly turned itself off then back on again four times but there's been no electrical fluctuations, the bucket is only half full and the relative humidity is far from the target level.Fortunately, I kept the box, the receipt and the box store is only 10 minutes away if I need to exchange the unit before the last one is sold out. There were only four in stock.Aww, rats!  The unit turned itself off/on again and now the panel is frozen.The unit again turned itself off/on and this time the panel is working.  Will I ever be able to finish this review?I'm exchanging it today.\",\n",

I got her some supplies to help, and this was the last on the list I wanted to give her. It was the highest rated tray on Amazon, so order away did I.I don\\'t know much about the cost of bamboo, but when I received the box I thought it to be rather small. When my wife opened it, I thought, \"That\\'s it?\" There wasn\\'t really much to assemble, and I didn\\'t think there would be, but I was expecting a little more for $50.When I plugged in the metallic stands, I was surprised to find that they don\\'t really snap in or anything, so they\\'re bound to come loose if you\\'re holding from them. Not that you would be, but you can\\'t hang it up. It\\'s nice, however, that the stands have rubber grips on the arms to prevent sliding around on the edges of the tub.The book stand is of the same material and make as the stands, so I\\'m not sure if it\\'ll hold up to heavier books. Also, the notches to hold the books at various angles are cut through the wood, meaning water can easily splash from underneath and onto the pages. I realize some might expect things on the tray to get wet once in a while, but the tray could be designed better to prevent as much soaking as possible.The slots to put in the wine glass and for the bar of soap are nice, and the height of the wine slot is thick enough to put any size wine glass stand. My wife doesn\\'t drink much, but she decided to pour herself a glass of wine to test it out. It worked great, though she didn\\'t finish the wine...The spot to put the soap is nice and is porous, though I can\\'t remember off the top of my head if the pores go through the wood like the book stand slots. There are also little ridges on the back of the tray to hold things like a sponge or razor, though, if you have the water pretty high, they\\'ll probably dip off into the water.It\\'s a decent tray that seems sturdy enough, but for the price I can\\'t recommend it highly. It\\'s the highest rated one out there for its quality, I presume, but the wood seems to be the only thing people like about it. Which makes sense, seeing as its going to spend its lifetime mostly near the water. But everything else, its notches and metal arms, could use redesigning.',\n",

Which is exactly what we needed for an older model, small one-story, 2 bedroom home. It had a much older model air conditioner in the wall which was very large. When that finally had to be retired, we installed a smaller window air conditioner in the wall of the house and that was an extremely large job (which took many hours and much material to make the hole in the wall small enough to accommodate the new air conditioner). That worked OK for a couple of years, but, when that air conditioner also failed, we were so pleased to find this unit which was made for wall installation. Again, it took a couple of hours and a couple of men who knew what they were doing to install it, and the size of the hole in the wall had to be modified to fit this unit, but, once done, it has been awesome! This unit is powerful enough to effectively cool the whole house, except for one room (the master bedroom which has its own window unit). I am very, very pleased with this Frigidaire product and the remote control is wonderful, as the location of the unit makes it difficult for all of the family members to access the front panel to adjust the settings.

After days of reading reviews on Amazon and looking at dehumidifiers in the flesh locally, I decided on the PerfectAire found at my local Ace Hardware. It was tempting to save a few bucks by buying the 30 gallon model, but I resisted the temptation.At first the PerfectAire disappointed until I read in the directions to initially run the unit in the continuous mode. It's been smooth sailing since.The dehumidifier is in our cathedral ceilinged living room and set at 40% humidity. Amazingly it reaches that level in short order and then cycles on and off until the reservoir is filled. The turn off is smooth, not the loud herky-jerky event I've experienced with other dehumidifiers.I like the easy to monitor visual on the front that alerts the user at all times to how much water is in the tank. You must be careful emptying the tank. First it is very heavy since it holds a lot of water. Second you must be careful because the bottom is not totally flat so the tank can tip backwards making a mess.  There is no curved pouring spout on the water tank so I've found it best to empty it in the bathtub or take it outside for the plants. The tank fills up about every 12 hours for us.I would have given the PerfectAire five stars but:It's not nearly as quiet as I had hoped. It's as loud as a fan running on medium and is even louder running in the turbo mode.This dehumidifier throws off a lot of heat, more than the replaced Soleus did and more than the old dehumidifier I have in the basement. For this reason you wouldn't want to place this unit in a small, enclosed area. When I first set up the unit, it was within four feet of the thermostat. The blast of hot air was hitting the thermostat with such force that it raised the temperature five degrees. Moving the dehumidifier solved the problem.Bottom line - This dehumidifier really sucks the water out of the air. Just don't sit next to it when watching TV, and don't use it in a small, enclosed room.\",\n",

All the other ones I have owned have been rectangular and didn't swivel.  This one is triangular and I really like that it swivels.  It works well on my bamboo floor & my linoleum tile bathroom floor.  It lines up in corners under cabinets and against the walls, unlike my rectangular ones, which have rounded ends, I could never get quite close enough.  The water tank is easy to fill and I was able to get 2 rooms done on one tank, my other models I had to refill for the 2nd room.  It was easy to assemble too, the only downside is that you have to keep pushing the trigger to produce steam, and by the end of two rooms, my hand hurt.  My other models just produced steam and kept steaming, no triggers involved.  So other than that, I would recommend this model for steam cleaning your floors.\",\n",

       " 'B005HGD9VY': {'Best review': 'To combat the dry air commonly found in winter, I have used humidifiers for as long as I can remember.  I have used various types and I tend to prefer the ultrasonic humidifiers due to their low noise and the lack of required filters and other parts that other types of humidifiers commonly use.Let us start with the basics.  The HERA ultrasonic humidifier is basically another ultrasonic humidifier.  The basic functionality of the product is not much different than any other ultrasonic humidifier that I have ever seen.  The unit creates a spout of water mist, which in theory will evaporate before hitting the ground and humidify the air.  The product does this and does this well.However, the HERA Ultrasonic Humidifier has a pretty hefty price tag compared to many other models.  What sets the HERA brand apart from the rest?The HERA Ultrasonic Humidifier has touchpad controls that allow the user to customize the humidifier settings to their own preferences.  The humidifier has a warm mist feature that helps take the cold, wet feeling out of the room.  There is the option of three different output levels.  The humidifier can be set up to shut off when it reaches a predetermined humidity level and there is a digital hygrometer to show you the humidity level of the room.  The night mode will dim the LCD display if the light bothers you at night.  The unit is equipped with a filter cartridge meant to reduce the hardness level of your water and an ionic silver cube meant to help keep the water bacteria free.I personally found most of the functions on the humidifier pretty intuitive.  I did have to refer to the manual a few times to figure out exactly what certain buttons did.  I felt that the manual was very poorly designed.  I thought the content of the manual was fine, but the layout of the manual was not very user friendly in my opinion.  While I did not have problems figuring out how to fill the tank, my wife did have to take some time to figure out where the water went.There were some things I really liked about the unit.  I thought the output level of the unit was powerful.  On the highest setting with the unit 2 feet off the ground, the water did not evaporate before it hit the ground.  I thought the unit was very aesthetically pleasing.  It is an attractive box form that can fit in a number of areas easily.  I thought the warm mist was a nice option that I felt made a difference in the feel of the air in the room.  One of the things I liked best was that the tank is square, which makes for easy filling.  I have had other shaped tanks that were a pain to try and hold while filling with several gallons of water.The hygrometer seemed to be fairly accurate for the most part.  I put another hygrometer in the same room and the readings were pretty close.  The only exception to this is when I filled the tank.  The hygrometer on the humidifier would read too high for a few minutes after filling the tank.  If the auto mode is being utilized, it will usually shut off until the reading corrects itself.What I did not like about the unit is the concept of the filter cartridge.  I live in an area with pretty hard water.  There is a water softener in my house, but I know many people do not have one.  I have used ultrasonic humidifiers for years before I put my water softener in and I will admit after about 3 or 4 winters, I will usually have to clean the humidifier out with vinegar and a soft brush.  While the idea of the filter cartridge did intrigue me,  it is a disposable part and one that might need to be changed frequently.The humidifier comes with a test strip.  The test strip appears to be German and measures in units of Degrees of Hardness (dH) and the instructions measures water hardness in \"pink boxes.\"  I took a sample of untreated water in my house and using test strips, I measured it to be about 250 ppm (parts per million) or about 15 gpg (grains per gallon).  Using the provided test strip, it measured about 17 dH or about 3.5 pink boxes.  In my later research, I found that the gpg and dH measurements are not identical, but for this purpose, they are close enough to use interchangeably.So why am I spending so much time talking about water hardness?  The filter cartridge life is dependant on water hardness.  With 15gpg/17dH water hardness level at my house without the water softener, I can expect the filter cartridge to last for 20 to 40 gallons of water or 10 to 20 fills of the tank.  At the time of this writing, a Stadler Form A-112 replacement cartridge runs $15 to $20.  The Stadler Form Replacement Ionic Silver Cube is supposed to be replaced annually and currently that runs another $25.My treated water is about 1 gpg.  According to the manual, at this hardness level, the filter should last about 115 gallons of water or about 58 fills.While I liked the humidifier, the price of replacement cartridges and silver cubes can be quite expensive.  Both of these items are optional to use, but if you take those aspects away, then this is just another ultrasonic humidifier and then there are many more cost effective alternatives available.  Those alternatives might not be as stylish and the controls might not be as user friendly, but when it comes down to it, without the filter cartridge, my $50 Sunbeam has most of the same functions as this one.Overall, I thought it was an excellent product worthy of 5 stars.  However, keep in mind that there is potentially quite an expense to utilize the product to its full potential.  For that, I am deducting 2 stars.',\n",

We\\'ve had the Kirby for years and it is a workhorse; however, I wanted a vacuum that was a little more manueverable especially on the hardwood floors.  The Sebo is easy to use but does not have an auto drive feature so it is quite a workout to vacuum regular wall-to-wall carpeting.  The wood floors and area rugs are a breeze, though, and this vacuum actually handles them better than my Kirbly which can be a bit unwieldy.  I like the Sebo\\'s ease of use around corners and tight spots.  The swivel action is wonderful.  The low-profile head is particularly useful for reaching under the dining room chairs and the family room coffee table.  The head is so low to the ground that it even reaches under a few inches of my refrigerator and under the lower kitchen cabinets all the way to the baseboards, something my Kirby can\\'t do with it\\'s giant head.I think the Sebo does a better job on my low-pile area rugs, it really gets them clean (great suction) without \"sucking\" them up like the Kirby does.  Downside is that you have to reach down to the head to switch the head height to go between floor types.  On the Kirby there is a foot peddle which has spoiled me.  One bonus is that the Sebo has an indicator like that tells you if the setting is too high.  Very convenient.  The Sebo also offers a variable suction control but I\\'m not sure why you wouldn\\'t want full suction power.  Also, the Sebo is quite a bit quieter than my Kirby and doesn\\'t frighten the dog as much.I haven\\'t tried emptying it yet but I\\'m sure I will appreciate not needing to special order Hepa filters for it like I do for the Kirby.  The Seba will likely become my main downstairs vacuum where we have a lot of hardwood flooring and the Kirby will go upstairs where it is almost all carpeting.  Can\\'t say that I relish the idea of pushing the Sebo around all that carpet, my biceps would be huge. :)Final Verdict:  The Sebo seems to be a very good machine and I hope it will last for years as it is not an inexpensive machine.  My only caution is the lack of auto-drive.  If you are not a strong person and plan to use this on large expanses of push carpeting, you should probably keep shopping.',\n",

We had another little orange one from a major vac manufacturer name, and it was just about useless.  This wins, no questions asked.  You have some maintenance to do, like any vacuum.  You wash and dry the foamy filter.  You need to wash out the inner tank sometimes.  You will have to cut the hair and such from the beater bar.  And you will sometimes need to disconnect the top from the bottom and &#34;fish&#34; through the little suction tunnel from top to bottom.We have a german shepherd, and she sheds like there is no tomorrow.  We use this daily to keep the hardwood floors and tile floors of the first floor clean.  And it works on surface dirt on the carpet that is on the stairs.  It isn't something that gets down deep into pile carpet, but for surface dirt it works great.  And on hardwoods, there is nothing better.Our Shark Navigator Pro is also a winner.  That is mostly used upstairs and for deep cleaning the area rugs downstairs  every so often as this little one cannot get deep down into carpets.The battery still gets at least 20 minutes of use before it stops working.  This is consistent with when it was new, and it is over 2 years old now.  Do yourself a favor and buy this.  It works, and it works great.  It is so easy to use, you will find yourself not minding to vacuum daily.\",\n",

They are very simple, but they complete the task perfectly.  Using them is easy, you just snap the two pieces around the bag and push them together.  They do an excellent job.  In fact, if you left air in the bag and try to push it out after placing the clip you likely will not be getting the air out.You can use them for crackers, chips, snack bags, bread (much better than the standard bread ties), and just about anything else.  You can also seal liquids in bags, but I'd be careful.  If the bag is really slick and the contents are heavy, there is a possibility it'd slip out of the clip.The clips can be measured and trimmed to suit your needs, but I'd just recommend buying various sizes.  The best thing about these clips is that they cannot be broken.  There are not any springs or flimsy plastic parts like the standard chip clips.

The width of the area between the door opening and the wall is 15\" so in order to get back the 3-4 inches, I needed to go to the narrower 14\" shelving.  I researched and found these.  I\\'ve just ordered my 5th set and they are truly the 350lb/shelf rugged variety versus the ones from Whitmore which are lighter weight and strength.  The reason I ordered the Whitmore was I didn\\'t need the wheels and the Whitmore were less money without the wheels which I thought was the only difference.  It is not.  These are heavy duty and the Whitmore is light weight relatively speaking.I would have liked to order taller shelving but couldn\\'t find it online so instead I am getting some shelf extenders from Metro and adding one half of the uprights to extend the shelves to where I need them.',\n",

       " 'B00440EKRG': {'Best review': 'You may think that you would be crazy to spend $300 on this thing...I mean, this thing is massive, unattractive, and expensive. It also generates heat and uses a good bit of energy when on higher settings and ran 24-7. So why would you pay $300 for this ugly thing when you can get smaller and \\'stylish\\' air purifiers for the same price that are also rated for larger rooms?I can tell you why this $300 hunk of ugly is worth every penny. I had asthma when younger. I have bad allergies. I have multiple medical conditions that are aggravated by environmental contaminants and certain air-borne particular matter. I\\'ve owned tons of air filters. I\\'ve owned many of the \\'experimental\\' purifiers such as the Ionic Breeze. And I\\'ve found most models on the market to seriously suck. In terms of real-world performance, HEPA is the only way to go.The filter is MASSIVE. The filter is a REAL HEPA. The 0.3 micron rating is exactly what you want...many of the other home products are 3 micron...the difference in .3 versus 3.0 is the difference in the filter effectively trapping particles that can make one ill versus simply recirculating these particles back into the air you then breath. The amount of air this thing moves is tremendous. It\\'s CEDR rating blows everything else at this price-point away (and note that many of the other models rated for larger rooms have a much lower CEDR rating, or no CEDR rating listed visibly on the box, or at all). This is one of the few home products that really CAN effectively handle large rooms. So you have a unit with good turnover and exceptional filtration, which is what you want if you are serious about air quality.I dislike how \"HEPA\" is so loosely used in the industry...many good people have been deceived by makers with questionable integrity. A REAL HEPA filter MUST remove AT LEAST 99.97% of airborne particles 0.3 micrometers (m) in diameter. A stat on a box saying \"removes 99.97% of particles\" is a useless figure because the particle size is omitted. It quickly becomes clear that many of the \"HEPA\", \"HEPA-grade\" or \"HEPA-efficiency\" or \"HEPA-spec\" or maker-created terms that include the word \"HEPA\" ARE NOT REAL HEPA FILTERS. What are the implications of this? Harm to the end-user...especially those with medical conditions needing good filtration. Someone with asthma, allergies, environmental sensitivities, or a condition that is flared by environmental contaminants will live a greater quality of life with good filtration...and a lower quality filter can actually aggravate as it pulls settled particles into the air and recirculates them rather than trapping. A true HEPA from a product with a high CEDR rating will make a massive improvement over a filter which is not a true HEPA. We can talk numbers all day long, but the biggest difference is one that the end user themselves will experience. While this is more pronounced with people who have medical conditions, it is something everyone will notice. Remember, indoor air is NOT of high quality.The controls are easy to use. The manual is not overly long, but also not to brief you are left with questions you have to take to the internet to answer via hours of your own time. The product is made by Whirlpool...the brand is known for usually making good quality stuff and standing behind their products. The AP51030K seems to continue their trend of high quality products. It is important to note that the pre-filter is more of a pre-filter than a carbon filter. By that I mean it traps larger particles that would otherwise shorten the lifespan of the HEPA filter significantly. In terms of carbon filtration to remove odors, the amount of carbon in this unit does NOT make it well-suited for serious odor removal. Therefore, this unit is better suited to users wanting to filter the particles that cause breathing/allergy issues than the users looking for something to remove odors. Use of more than 1 pre-filter may be possible, but I have not tried it as I don\\'t use it for that purpose...please note that I would advise contacting the maker before attempting this, as it can impact flow dynamics and may or may not be safe for the motor. Like most high-efficiency filters, it should be cleaned and cleaned often. Removing visible debris from the pre-filter will extend the life of the pre-filter, the HEPA filter, and the motor (by decreasing flow-resistance caused by larger particulate matter).So is $300 worth it? Absolutely. As of today, the best all-around filtration is a true HEPA...and you need a sizable filter and a sizable motor. Therefore, any good filter will have a larger form-factor. The AP51030K is pure performance and while it is by no means cheap, its performance outclasses many filters that cost significantly more. For the home user, it is arguably the best choice on the market in terms of cost versus performance. Ionic filtration such as the Ionic Breeze simply sucks. I\\'ve owned them and they are a waste. I\\'ve owned many non-HEPA models and their effectiveness is usually outright poor. I\\'ve owned many lesser quality filters and they are a waste. Stick with a true HEPA. The real-life outcomes speak for themselves, and the best way to see this first hand is to try it yourself. For that person in your life with asthma or allergies, the HEPA filter is as major of a breakthrough as the inhaler or anti-histamines. In this sense, the high price of the AP51030K is 100% justifiable because IT IS AN INVESTMENT FOR GOOD HEALTH.',\n",

I might get the 2.5\" for times when I\\'m going to load the grill.  The nice thing is you get a solid 3 to 4 hours between rewaters if it is setting on top of the SN and you are smoking at 225F.  At 250F you get a little over 2 hours because the water boils more vigorously.When I smoke at higher temps like 250 and above though I change the placement of the pan.  I set it on the charcoal grate right up against the SN.  I bring the Kettle up to my desired temp, pour boiling water through the grill, filling the pan.  Then I load the meat on the grill grate.  At 250 not much water simmers out but it acts like a nice heat sink to keep the temperature under control.  At 275 and above you get a nice simmer.I\\'m definitely glad I got the 4 inch pan.  With the SN FILLED with Kingsford Blue Bag charcoal and my wood of choice I can easily get 4-5 hours between reloads on the charcoal and wood.  The SN almost becomes a set it and forget it once you have the temperature stabilized.  Not quite, but close!  On a calm, sunny day, I have no problem running errands for an hour or two.

I bought the first because it had a large tank, has a prodigious mist output, and a relatively small footprint. This unit has been in operation for over two years now and works perfectly well. I find them to be very reliable and requiring little maintenance. The small fan in the unit is sufficient to move the mist across a room with no real effort. Because of this experience, I've bought two more. It is necessary to clean the transducer on a regular basis as it does tend to accumulate a mineral scale that reduces the efficiency of the mist production. A solution of vinegar and water will disolve the scale pretty well so that the transducer can be cleaned using a tooth brush. I find that running at 40% for 12 hours a day, the tank will last about 4 days before needing to be refilled. My major complaint is that the tank is difficult to fill. It is fairly tall and needs to be filled from the bottom. But, as the top is not flat,it will not rest under the faucet so you have to be a bit creative holding the tank to fill it. I find that the only faucet in my condo tall enough to fill the tank is my bathtub so that is a bit inconvenient. since the unit does put out a fair amount of mist, I would caution against setting it too high. I would think that for an average room a setting of about 30-40% might be sufficient.Pro's: Good mist output, no filter, small footprint, open base design makes cleaning easy, quiet.Con's: Somewhat difficult to fill, output is not directional; shoots straight up, simple controls; just like the volume control on a radio, no humidistat, no power on light\",\n",

This means that there is nothing solid beneath the veneer at the location of the screw holes. Additionally, the bolts provided are about 1/4 inch longer than they should be.***If you tighten these screws you will crack the veneer and cause bulging on the table surface.***To avoid this problem while still tightening the bolts to an acceptable level, you need to use washers or some other form of spacer between the frame and tabletop.Having said that, I stand by my previous statement that, for the price, this product is acceptably well made, sturdy and aesthetically appealing.\",\n",

The power button is conveniently placed on the handle.I am impressed by the suction and pick up of this vacuum. We had four dogs in the home during my visit and plenty of dog hair. This Windtunnel did an amazing job picking up the dog hair, and I was amazed by the amount of hair it picked up.Emptying the dirt container is easy and convenient. Flip a button and the bottom opens up to release the collected dirt and hair. The filtrations system of the Hoover is also a nice feature as is the rotating brush attachment for the hose.I missed not having a light on the vacuum, but certainly wouldn't consider this omission a deal breaker.Bottom line - I enjoyed using the Hoover bagless for a week and was favorably impressed. This model is worth considering, especially for those who prefer a bagless model.\",\n",

They have worked the same for me.My husband choose one as a holiday gift at his work a few years ago from the group of $20 gifts. He knows how much I love popcorn. At first I was skeptical because it feels cheap and flimsy. We had been using a really old, large, very cheap, covered stock pot. It belonged to his grandmother and worked so well because it had thin walls and a thin floor. It was light and easy to shake and it would build up steam and heat quickly in the aluminum pot. But it wasn't designed for popcorn and the small handles would get scorching. The big plus side is that I could make an enormous amount of popcorn in it at once.This Wabash Valley Farms Whirley-Pop device has the same important features of thin metal that hold in steam for rapid heat production. The pot will not have to heat up like a heavier pot would. This popper allows the heat to go directly and quickly into the oil and get changed to steam, which can be the most effective for popping the most kernels. The whirley stirring feature is an added bonus that permits you to keep unpopped and partially popped kernels in contact with the highest heat sources (oil and steam) instead of getting trapped by the popped kernels. The ability for the lid to flip up is practical if you end up with a lot of popped corn so it has some place to go and make room for more kernels to get big and fluffy.Because this popper helps create and retain high heat, you do not need much oil and you do not need a super high heat setting once the oil gets warmed. As the popping begins, be ready as it will finish quickly. I usually use less than a tablespoon of vegatable oil, such as Wesson canola oil. It leaves almost no taste and this is very little oil for the amount of popcorn you can make. It will not look like it has coated the bottom the pot while it is cool. That is my only complaint - I wish it had a larger capacity.Once the popping is going strong, turn down the heat setting, and begin cranking the whirley handle. It will finish popping in about a minute or less. If you covered the bottom of the pot with good popcorn kernels, such as Orville white (my favorite), the sides of the lids should be poking up and it may be getting a little difficult to whirl because the pot is FULL of fluffy popcorn.Transfer your popcorn to a bowl for your desired seasoning. I think that seasoning/buttering your popcorn is best when it is warm and fresh (unless you are saving it to make popcorn balls). Clean up is easy. The lid flops around because of the whirley turner and is a bit awkward to clean, but simple. The pot is super straight-forward. All clean with soap and water and rinse out well.Here are some of my tips, as a popcorm lover and chef for your homemade popcorn enjoyment:**Salt popcorn BEFORE adding any butter or butter substitute. The salt will stick to any additional oils that are poured on the popcorn and tend to glop in places and some will taste super salty while others bland.**Whatever you do to the popcorn after it's popped, disperse it evening by shaking the popcorn and seasoning/butter together in a large covered container. It is like tossing a caesar salad.**If you like butter - use butter. There is no real substitute. Use small amounts and use the shake method after salting. Try pouring the melted butter down the sides of the container and add the popcorn and then shake. This way you avoid some kernels with a lot of butter and other without - unless you want that. It helps with even coating so you use less but achieve high flavor.**Try a unique salt blend such as a maple bbq salt rub that you would put on your ribs. Tossing your popcorn with a little goes a long way for a spicy, savory treat. Mesquite rubs are also yummy! Lawrys has several commercial options.**Drizzle the sides of your shaking container with small amounts of ice cream sundae caramel. Toss in your salted popcorn and shake away. This will coat your popcorn for a salty, lightly sweetened surprise. (you could try chocolate sauce too, but not too much)**If you like kettle corn, try mixing a bit of light corn syrup with sesame oil and toss with the popcorn in your shaking container. Then toss with a bit of sugar and salt to taste. You need the corn syrup and oil to help the sugar and salt stick, but use a light hand with all of these additions. It is supposed to be reminiscent of kettle corn without cooking it in a kettle.Here's to the fun of popping!!\",\n",

I read the glowing report from another buyer and based my purchase on that, so I hope hers are better. My Mom reports that the songbird sheets are great, very soft and even a bit oversized to allow for shrinking. So maybe my set was a fluke or made at a different plant. It does appear the songbirds are a good set.I got the princess set for myself...I've never grown up. LOL. I will say they are soft to the touch no complaint there. They are not very thick but then they tell you 135gms. They only have elastic on the corners of the fitted sheets and that to me is disappointing as I find those to not stay put as well. The top sheet doesn't have much drop on the sides. They measure 11 inches deep at the corner and my mattress and pad topper together measure  12 inches so these pop off during the night.  They are a tight fit on my full bed with a 3 inch memory foam topper. They do not go under the top mattesss. As far as sleeping on them they are comfy and smooth. I just don't expect them to last years like Northern Nights from QVC that I am used to. For eight dollars and eleven cents they are worth that, but not when it comes to them popping off. They have to go back:{  So be aware if you have a mattress thicker than 10 inches these are not going to hug under the mattress unless my set was just a fluke.They are made in Pakistan not China that is a good point. I guess I am used to Portugal made flannel which is supposed to be the best. So all in all for the sale prices they are worth that much if your mattress in not too thick. No way would they stay on a 15inch thick mattress. Think about it. What they say is 12 inches and will fit at 15 inch mattress.\",\n",

It's a bit small if you have a very thick mattress, but the overall nice look makes up for the gaps at the corners and probably isn't an issue with an average mattress. Some people had concerns about wrinkling--personally I think ironing it is a waste. The one pillowcase and the bed skirt are sort of a seersucker material and actually look quite cute (in my opinion) with the puckered wrinkles. However the pilling on the quilt is really an issue. The backside of the cranberry quilt is white, and after two washes I began getting hundreds of tiny white pills all over the cranberry side. I guess the backside is coming off and pilling up on the colored side. If you are going to put this in a guest room and never sit on top of it, you will not need to wash it very often, and have no pets, I would recommend it. But if it's going to get regular use, I would definitely not suggest it for the cost. I've had this just a few months for my daybed (which I use regularly) in my living area, and I'm going to have to purchase a matching cranberry throw to cover it, because it looks pretty shabby unless I lint-roller it daily and take a sweater de-piller to it after washing. Once the quilt dies (I'm guessing it will have to go in about six more months) I'll get something hardier for the top.\",\n",

I was looking for a better way to store them and I finally settled on this.  I ordered the red one, not for any particular reason other than that it was the least expensive color available at the time.First of all, just to be clear, you will have to supply your own hanger.  This was not a problem for me as I have many extras.  I used a standard-sized plastic clothes hanger and it was fine.  It's in there pretty well and should support the weight of my jewelry, even when I fill this organizer up.  (It's really not very heavy, even partially filled.)  I hang mine on a bar in the closet so both sides are easily accessible.Another thing to note: the pockets do not seal, so if you were planning to store silver in here, there is a chance it will tarnish.  (I don't have much fine jewelry; most of mine is the &#34;fashion&#34; kind, so I don't have any tarnish problems.)  Because the pockets are open at the top, this would also not be a suitable jewelry carrier for travel.Finally, the loops on the back are sewn such that your necklace must have a clasp in order to use them (i.e., there's no Velcro closure, they're just loops of fabric); the loops are hung in straight vertical rows, so some longer necklaces will be on top of others.None of the things I have mentioned are a big deal for me, so I won't subtract from my rating because of those features.  But if those things are important to you, now you know!Two criticisms that do impact my rating: the color of mine is absolutely not the red color in the photo.  It's a dark (almost hot) pink.  I believe insufficient dye was used and this was the result.Second, and more importantly, the very first pocket I tried to use was not properly sealed/sewn at the bottom and could not actually hold any jewelry.  All of the other ones I've tested since then have been fine.The pockets are big enough for single strand bracelets and sets of five or fewer bangles.  Larger sets of bangle bracelets will need to go into the bottom row of pockets as these are a little larger.  Large earrings would also work in most of the pockets although using this for stud earrings would probably be overkill.Anyway, the one defective pocket is not a big enough problem for me to send this back.  (I can probably mend it with some tape if I'm so inclined.)  This works well enough for my purposes and with the amount of jewelry I have at this time.  However, I probably wouldn't buy the same item again.\",\n",

I had a trash can with the step-open lid which I preferred.  I must say that the motion sensor lid is a selling point but sometimes a draw back.  It often has a hard time seeing me wave my hand over the sensor to open it, but often it will open as I walk by.  Since I am using this trash can in the kitchen, it is quite bothersome when I can't get the trash can open when I have hands full of garbage.  Also, I sometimes need the lid to stay open longer than it does (like when I peel fruits or veggies over the trash can) and it often closes on me. I don't really like the smaller trash can.  The on and off switch is on the back and when it hits the wall it often shuts off. It's also difficult to get the sensor to open the lid and you have to bend down to activate it.  These trash cans are just OK.  I guess I could have spent twice the price for a better one, but these will do.\",\n",

Indeed, since we have beige towels to begin with and my samples came in beige, I actually thought I might have been using one of our older towels as I dried off on my first test - a quick check for the logo assured me I wasn't, but it was certainly a testament to the quality of the fabric used for these.A few dunks in the washer and drier later revealed that they retained their &#34;thirstiness&#34; with no perceivable loss of fabric softness.After a week of use, I can honestly say these towels are a keeper.

The holes were started, but they were not deep enough to get the screws in at all - and my husband is a strong guy!  These were also the two most difficulty set screws, and had they slid in as easily as all the other hardware, it would have been perfect.  Luckily I had just bought my husband a new drill bit set at the hardware store, and he had the perfect size to use without messing the holes or the wood at all.  Once put together, this is indeed a strong, sturdy bed.  Husband weights about 220 - 6 ft. tall.  I am about 110, 5 foot 2 inches tall.  There is no creaking or squeaking when we sleep - and we do sleep!  We just moved five weeks ago and left our old, twenty plus years queen size mattress and box spring, with a metal frame underneath, behind.  We swore no more metal frames to bang our toes and knees on.  This wood is simply beautiful - I plan to add a bit of shellac to the legs, but that's it.  We bought some felt pads to stick on the bottom of the legs and the bed is so easy to move on the hardwood floors this way.  As my husband is 78 and I am mid fifties - it took the two of us about an hour to put the bed together, along with the frame.  We had purchased an extra firm queen size mattress which rests nicely on this hardwood platform frame - no boxspring needed.  It would have elevated the mattress over the headboard, which is now the perfect height against our pillows.  The two of us have had our best sleep in years!As other reviewers stated, the holes line up beautifully and it's a snap almost to put together.  We ended up with six extra screws, good to hold on to just in case.UPDATE:  Am sticking with the four stars for the reason stated above.  We've had the bed over a year now and have had no problems with it.  Occasionally, we tighten the screws, which is simple and easy to do when changing sheets.  It's the first bed I've had that I haven't bruised my feet or knees on when trying to make the bed or change sheets.  I purchased a single frame without headboard for my daughter, and was able to put it together by myself in about 20 minutes.  The wood has held up on our bed - and it's perfect.\",\n",

I wasn't setting out to like this product as much as I did but now I am going to be purchasing another one for the guest bathroom.  Why the change of heart?  For me it was rather simple...  Hand soap for our family of 5 lasts longer because the children are no longer pumping away without recourse.  The second point was the fact that my bathroom sink was no longer messy from soap squirts that had congealed.  I was put at task every few days to clean the sticky disaster that the kids would leave me; now if they could figure out how to stop the globs of toothpaste every morning and night!Our sample soap lasted 1 1/2 months and the batteries are still going strong.  The Simple Human branded soap doesn't seem to be too expensive considering that you are receiving two 34 oz packages via Amazon's Subscribe & Save program.  The refills packages also have an easy-pour spout unlike the sample provided with the product.Pros:*No Dripping!  Does not drip at all.*Works wonderfully with the free Lavender sample provided.  Also worked with my Lavender Method hand soap without clogging or dripping.*Can be easily turned off by holding down the (-) sign for three seconds.*Germ-free user operation if you aren't turning it on and off.*You can regulate and monitor the amount that each individual is dispensed by pressing the (+)(-) signs to desired amount.*Soap lasts longer because of the set amount that is dispensed.*Quiet operation.*Clean operation that saves me precious clean up time.*Motivates the young ones to wash their hands because of the 'magic'!*Small foot stamp that does not get knocked over like regular soap dispensers.Cons:*Top plastic chrome constantly has water spots/stains.  Driving me crazy.*If placed very closely to the edge rim of the sink then just washing your hands under the water spout can activate and waste soap. (we remedied by placing it very far back from the edge since it does not drip/leak)*The previous pro became a con when during a recent get-together, the kids gathered in the bathroom to 'wash' their hands rather enthusiastically.  Never have I seen such clean little hands.  Wasted soap.*Thicker soaps and Bath & Body Works beads clog the nozzle a bit.*A bit expensive if you are planning on replacing all the manual pumps throughout your household.Highly recommend for those that are concerned with germs and have young children in their home that waste soap without supervision.  This has changed our washing hands habits and has made it a motivator for everyone to always remember to wash their hands.  SimpleHuman soap is not expensive if you think about the long term and considering changing the amount dispensed.

       " 'B004W7CLBS': {'Best review': \"Let's begin with some Words of Wisdom: Unless you know what pillow you want, buy from Bed Bath and Beyond. They are one of the few retailers that accepts returns of the Tempurpedic pillows (just don't open the plastic wrap!) and you can use a 20% off coupon! Yay!When I purchased my Cloud mattress, I received two symphony pillows for free with the cotton lining and cover-- not the new polyester covers/lining. I was told by a sales woman that nothing has changed about the pillows themselves over than the lining and cover.The Symphony pillows were firm at first, but they break in after about a week, and they've held up great for the last three years. But there is ONE problem: I get annoyed at the contoured sides that are made for different sleep positions. You have to flip the pillow if you are moving from your back to your side to be comfortable and if you don't-- ouch! My neck! Otherwise, it's an AMAZING pillow. It wouldn't be so big of a deal for me if I woke up, but I don't. I wake up when my neck starts to hurt. (insert sad face now). It's also not the best for a stomach sleeper.My Goal: find a pillow that I could use on my stomach, side AND back (I know lofty goals) that would give me the support that I needed without having to flip it over multiple times a night. (For reference, I'm a small woman-- just over 5 ft and I have a small frame)Now let's get to the Pillow Talk:Latex: soft and all sorts of springy with minimal to moderate support. I found that no latex pillow I've used gives me enough support. This is my preference, of course. I prefer memory foam. I don't like springy.After that latex fiasco, I went back to good ole tempur-pedic.My old standby-- the Symphony: medium firmness, very little spring. Great for side sleepers, but if you switch positions a lot-- this pillow can get annoying because you have to keep flipping it. Also, it's not great for stomach sleepers. If you are a side sleeper or a back sleeper-- you won't be sorry that you got this pillow. This actually reminds me the most of the Cloud mattress because it has a little bit of softness initially, but then it forms to your body just like the mattress does. It's very comfy with lots of support.Cloud: very soft, yet supportive, but springy. However, the &#34;springy-ness&#34; is a problem for me because the foam wants to rebound back into it's natural form. That makes my head tilt at an angle instead of lay flat which hurts my neck. This pillow looks lofty, but it has a lot of give when you put your head on it. It turns out to be about the same height as my symphony so I know it's not the height that's a problem-- I think it's the amount of recoil in this pillow which is an issue. It is incredibly soft and it wanted so badly for it to be MY pillow, but it wasn't. It is, however, very moldable and this pillow can work for stomach sleepers if you're willing to put half the pillow under your chest. Not ideal, but it can work because it's so pliable.Curve: firmest of the bunch, but a bit thinner than the Symphony and the Cloud. It is better if you're an &#34;every position&#34; sleeper including a stomach sleeper. The first night-- it's a bit hard, but the pillow gets softer with use. I'm not talking like it's so soft that you feel like your head is on a marshmallow (if that's your goal-- get the cloud), but if you've laid on tempurpedic mattresses, then you know what I mean: it molds to you and it becomes soft. I also kind of like the curve in the shape because it's actually difficult to fall off the pillow.  If you get the curve, then you should definitely get a Queen size because the standards are freakishly small.I thought about getting the traditional pillow, but it really seemed to mushy when I was playing with it at the store. If you can, I really recommend making a trip out to a store where you can at least play around with these pillows before you make that $100+ decision.Also, I live in Florida and I've never felt &#34;hot&#34; using a memory foam pillow. If that's a concern-- then I don't think any of these pillows will be a problem. AND the smell will go away in a couple of days. ;)Hopefully this helps you make the decision that's best for you!\",\n",

If there is something to spill on my carpet, I will spill it.  I also have pets - enough said.  I tried this out on the soda stain and what was left when my furball left me a furball on my bedroom carpet.  I went over it with this machine several times and it did not get the stains out.  They were still clearly visible when I was done.  I have had a Bissell ProHeat for about a year now and I absolutely love it (so much that I bought my mom one a few months ago).  When I finished earlier with this carpet cleaner, I thought to myself, \"These stains would be nothing for my Bissell ProHeat 2X.\"  Later I had to prove it to myself so I went ahead and pulled out my ProHeat and the stains came right out.  The brushes work so much better.  I hate to compare the machines like this, but for just a few extra dollars, you can get a really fantastic machine and I think it is worth it to guide you to that.  If you are concerned about the carpet being wet, there is a ProHeat model that comes with dryers as well.  This carpet cleaner is easy to maneuver but the water tank is so small.  I just think there aren\\'t enough advantages to this machine to recommend it, but I also think the Bissell ProHeat 2X is a true 5-star machine and highly recommend it if you need to deep clean your carpet and get rid of some yucky stains.',\n",

       " 'B007N6ZDUQ': {'Best review': '[Update June 2014:  Still running fine.  Since last winter was so warm, I kept the AC in the window until January.  The AC runs 24x7 for over 6 months of the year.  Even when the weather is nice, we still run the AC due to the pollen.]I\\'ve been running this AC for about 3 weeks. The AC runs non-stop in the bedroom -- I live in the South and the humidity is very high during the summer.I love this A/C; the A/C removes gallons of water daily and I actually like the sound of the fan as a very nice white noise generator.  I\\'m not sure if the weather is cooler this year than previous years but month after month, my electrical bill has significantly dropped (compared to previous years) after I installed several small window A/C units.Although I have a working HVAC, I prefer window AC units because I want to tailor the temperature of each room and I don\\'t heat or cool some extra rooms unless we have company.  The other reason why I use window AC units is that they are far more energy efficient than a well-maintained HVAC system.  My electric bills are dramatically lower when I use Energy Star window AC units (they pay themselves off in just one month).As an aside, I live in a development with an HOA so I don\\'t put any window AC units in front of the house.I keep the bedroom cold; below 70 degrees (in the winter, I don\\'t heat the bedroom). But downstairs I prefer the temperature much warmer (75-78 degrees) and if the outdoor humidity is low I won\\'t run the window AC at all or run the A/C until the humidity drops.I have three (3) window A/C units that are virtually identical to each other except that there are minor differences to the control panel and louvers but they all use the almost identical remote control units.  They weigh the same, cost the same, have the same internal parts and positioning of the parts. I\\'m guessing that they\\'re all made by the same manufacturer under different names.NOISE:I run the Hanover A/C in the bedroom at the high fan speed. The A/C noise has a pleasant smooth sound like a white noise generator.  My window Frididaire AC units make horrible irritating sounds -- the noise from the Frididaire grates on my nerves and I don\\'t stay in the room while the Frididaire AC is running.I have another Hanover-like AC downstairs.  With the fan at low speed, the noise is minimal which doesn\\'t interfere with conversations.  I don\\'t have to leave the room or turn the AC off when using a phone.Running the A/C at low fan speed will still allow you to hear the TV.LOUVERS:The Hanover louvers can be only be angled left or right.WATER ACCUMULATION:If you live in a humid climate, pay attention to the following.The problem with all of the window AC units is that water and crud (small leaves, seeds, bugs) accumulate on the inside bottom of the AC.  If you live in a humid climate, the fan that is supposed to remove the water by spraying it out through the side grates makes a sloshing sound which drives me nuts.  I always think that there\\'s a water leak in the house or the toilet is running.The water and debris create an ugly mess on the bottom.  At the end of the season when I remove the ACs for winter, I take the AC outdoors and use a hose and run water at high pressure to wash out the junk.Since there\\'s always water on the bottom of the AC, the bottom fins of the radiator is always wet.  The bottom fins and other metal parts will start rusting after a season or two.All the window ACs have a lot of water droplets on the louvers which blows water (with the gunk on the bottom of the AC) back into the room.  I have this problem with all small window AC units. This problem is not unique to this Hanover.I finally came up with a solution that solves all of the water problems.  Since the bottom of these units (Hanover and their clones) are plastic, if you shine a very bright flashlight with a tight beams on the bottom of the AC, you can find areas where water has accumulated and there are no internal parts.  What I did was after locating several safe locations (no internal parts), I marked those spots with a magic marker. Then using a drill, I cut several large holes through the plastic bottom.  The bottom is now totally dry -- the radiator and surrounding area is no longer sitting in water for months on end. If the holes are large enough, seeds, leaves, dust and bugs will be washed away when it rains.NOTE: If the water dripping out of the bottom of the AC will fall onto an area you don\\'t want to get wet (like a deck), then DON\\'T drill any holes.  Even with the bedroom door always closed, the AC removes several gallons of water each day.  A smaller Forstner (example:Steelex D3655 Forstner Bit Set in Case, 7-Piece) bit won\\'t grab and pull up like common metal drill bits.  Work slowly and concentrate on what you\\'re doing and all will go well.SIZE:The extenders will fit a 36\" wide window.  With the extenders fully pushed in, the A/C will fit a window as narrow as 22.5\" or 16\" with the extenders removed.WEIGHT:The AC weighs about 40 pounds.  I\\'m pretty small and I can easily insert and remove the AC from the window by myself.BOXING:Unlike previous A/C units that I had shipped from Amazon, this A/C is double boxed.  That is, the manufacturers box is now enclosed within a sturdy outer box so the chances of receiving a damaged unit due to rough handling is greatly reduced.VERDICT:I\\'m glad that I bought this and would buy it again.  The price and weight is reasonable, the noise isn\\'t irritating, the Hanover has real buttons on the control panel which I really like and outputs very cold air.  I save several hundred dollars each month by running window ACs and I have to run the bedroom AC for over 6 months each year.',\n",

We have a 1 year old and we know from past experience how dry hotel rooms can be and we have seen the benefits of having one and the issues small kids tend to have in dry environments without one.  In the past we have helped bring a full size humidifier with us this time we were traveling without the benefit of additional family members.  This small unit worked great.  it was exactly what we were looking for and worked flawlessly the entire trip.  Aside from the travel days between cities, this little guy was running continuously the whole time in each and every hotel we stayed at.Things I liked:+ fast mist+ small size+ easy to use+ easy to clean+ no small crevices to hide water (extremely useful if you will be moving around a lot)+ automatically shuts off when water level gets low (LED changes to red to warn you)+ runs without refilling for 6-8 hours on high*  (as long as you're willing to ignore the manufacturer's warnings against using larger bottles)+ fold out stabilizer legs to improve stabilityThings I didn't like too much:- blue operation LED is VERY bright (for my taste, my wife didn't mind too much)- blower remains on if you run out of water even when the humidifier stops running- exhaust port did fall shut several times.  didn't stop operation just didn't allow much mist to escapeSome things I learned:* be sure to position the exhaust port near the edge of a tabletop or the falling mist can condense on the table and create a puddle that can seep under the unit* I used the 1liter SMARTWATER bottle and it worked great.  no instability issues maybe because the profile of the bottle is slimmer.* never had a problem with the bottle base, it was easy to install and reuse, and never leaked* out of the box, setup, plug in, supply water, producing mist in 2 minutes ( hist is actually almost instantaneous when you turn it onn with water available.I really liked this humidifier and hope it continues to hold up for future trips.  I would highly recommend to other that travel with kids!UPDATE: 02/2014Well, the little guy finally broke down.  In an extended trip this past holiday season we used the humidifier in the hotels and aboard a cruise ship.  About 2 weeks into the trip I noticed that the midday level was dropping.  We tried to clean the unit with shine vinegar and LOTS of deposits came off the inside (I blame the water on board the cruise ship).  Additionally I learned not to use the new thin walked bottles.  I tried one in Rome and instead of allowing the water to fall into the reservoir, the vacuum collapsed the bottle and then overflowed the reservoir and leaked all over the table and into the blower vent. I don't know if either or both of these things contributed to the units failure but I still would recommend this unit.  The The portability, price, and function is still a great unit.  I will be replacing it before my next trip.\",\n",

Relatively simple to put together, though you do need a drill. I can\\'t imagine putting this thing together without one. Otherwise, it comes with a screw driver and allen wrench.I suppose I could have simply bought a cheap metal frame, but while I didn\\'t want something expensive that I\\'d have to unload in a few months, I did want something with a little more presence than a barebones metal frame. This fits the bill fairly well.Some things that may not be immediately obvious when considering this bed:* The slats are basically particle board. Wild sex is probably not a great idea on this bed. I\\'m actually mildly concerned about this aspect of the bed, and I guess time will tell if it actually holds up (I\\'ve never used a bed with particle board slats before-usually metal slats on previous beds I\\'ve owned, but they\\'ve admittedly been considerably more expensive).* The black frame is not particle board and is made of solid wood. Not sure what type of wood.* The lip the slats rest on is very soft (pine?) and not very confidence boosting either, and not particularly straight. Not a problem really, just be methodical in straightening them as you screw them to the frame. Don\\'t stress over there being no visible mark on the frame to line the lips at either. You can eyeball it, as they don\\'t need to be perfectly aligned with each other (there\\'s wiggle room on the placement of the slats).* There\\'s a decent sized gap between the mattress, and any wall you might have this bed up against. Just keep that in mind if you were expecting to use a wall as a pseudo headboard. I\\'m using a 10\" Full sized Memory Foam Mattress and it fits perfectly in the space it\\'s supposed to, so not seeing the issue others have with the frame being bigger than the mattress, but the space I talk about is due to the thickness of the frame itself, combined with the legs being on the outside head/foot of the bed, rather than on the side of the frame (left/right), which adds another inch and half plus the thickness of the frame to the separation between your wall and your mattress.* The instructions aren\\'t great, but if you have any experience putting furniture together, that probably isn\\'t a surprise. I honestly can\\'t recall ever having great instructions come with furniture, so it\\'s hard to knock this bed for that. Construction is fairly straight forward regardless. The lips are really the only part that you could conceivably screw up, so take care with those.Had it shipped over the Pacific for $12.99 with overnight shipping as a Prime member. Considering the weight of the box (and the fact that I ordered a mattress through Amazon as well), I suspect this was an oversight on someone\\'s part, as I can only imagine what the shipping ended up costing them (nearly every bed I\\'ve seen on Amazon says it can\\'t be shipped here, heh). So, that was pretty amazing in my quest to find a budget bed for my temporary stay here.Main reason for the 3 stars is my lack of any real confidence in the particle board slats, even if the bed is functioning just fine at the moment.',\n",

       " 'B002ZDJYC0': {'Best review': 'Update, 2/8/14:I am changing my rating to one star. I originally gave it 5 stars. Last summer, after having owned two of these for less than 2 years, we noticed they both constantly went into \"defrost\" mode, with the P1 display and runnning at turbo speed, wasting electricity. They would do this even when they had just been plugged-in or shortly after they had been plugged-in. Also, we noticed that the humidity reading seemed to be really off. It would register low humidity, even when we placed it directly in front of a damp spot. The units were not pulling much moisture from the air, as evidenced by the low water level in the bucket, even after running for hours.This week, we attempted to use both of them because we got a lot of rain and a bit of water in our basement. NEITHER unit is working. After 15 hours of running, each of them had 1/2\" to 3/4\" of water in the bucket. That was it. Meanwhile, they would run for a while and then P1 would show on the display and it would be in \"defrost\" mode, supposedly.We did NOT use these units every day, so we didn\\'t wear them out. We only used them when we got some water in the basement or on very humid summer days. So they were used maybe 20-30 days per year. When not in use, they were up on cement blocks with a plastic bag over them to keep dust out. And now they are dead and I own two expensive bricks. Of course, the warranty period is over.Yet another example of cheap Chinese junk being imported into this country, being sold -- at $200 a pop -- and then turning into garbage. Great.My original enthusiastic review is below. You can ignore any praise I gave the units, but there may be other information in the review that you will find helpful. I am off to buy another dehumidifier, but NOT a Sunpentown unit!*****************************************Wow, Amazon continues to make me a happy customer. Our basement flooded, due to 8 inches of rain that fell in a short period of time. After getting all the water off the floor, the basement was still extremely damp and humid. We already had one dehumidifier, an old Kenmore that has served us well. But that was not going to cut it for a full, wet basement. Before I even finished Shop-vaccing, I got online, read the reviews on Amazon, picked the Sunpentown based on the reviews and picked overnight shipping (cheap, because I have Amazon Prime). I knew I would have no time to get to a store, and that seemed like the best option.The unit arrived the next afternoon. It is a bit heavy (50 pounds), so I dragged it in the house, unboxed it upstairs and carried it down to the basement. Put it in the part of the basement opposite the older dehumidifier, turned it on \"Turbo\" and away it went. Wow, that\\'s all I have to say. The unit can really draw moisture out of the air amazingly fast. I emptied the (full) bucket 3 times in the first 24 hours! In just a couple of hours, the basement was noticeably less humid.It\\'s now been a full 48 hours, and the unit is still drawing a lot of moisture from the air. According to its display, it has lowered the humidity from 60% to 40%. Best of all, my basement floor is about 90% dry. I don\\'t know about the future, but as of right now, I am totally impressed.PROS:Efficient at removing moisture.Relatively quieter than our ancient dehumidifier. On \"Turbo\", it sounds like a loud fan.Hey, you can dry some laundry by hanging it above the exhaust, which is on top of the unit!Convenient red ball float lets you quickly see how full the unit is.Nice neutral color.Wheels/castors let you roll it wherever you need it.CONS:Box is heavy to get into the house.Bucket is quite heavy when it is full.A little water always spills when removing the bucket. (Not a problem if you use the continuous drain feature.)The exhaust puts out quite a bit of heat and has warmed the basement. That would be bad if you were using it in a living space during the summer time.',\n",

It really is and feels very nice and comforting.2) Pillow has no virtually odors out of the box. The box is nice, as comes very protected and not in a plastic bag.3) Not as expensive compared to others seen. There is a Hydrolux pillow here that is like 50-bucks+ and this one has SAME cooling surface made by Hydrolux (also sold on Amazon), and it is considerably cheaper! LOLCons:1) Pillow is VERY thin, definitely NOT 4\" thick as shown here. It is more like 2\" - 3\" tops. This may pose a problem for proper neck support and it seems now that I have to add a 2nd thin pillow below it (keeping the green surface towards my head) because I am a side sleeper and this is WAY to thin.2) It is a bit expensive for me to have to add 2nd pillow below it to have decent support/height, so that is a con.3) Cooling surface does not stay cool all night, of course. But it helps a bit to help fall asleep in 20-30mins before it warms up to your normal body temp.4) Not washable, so Lysol is as good cleaning as you can give it. :-/Thoughts so far (to be updated):This is not as expensive as some other pillows and it is extremely soft, which is nice. The only pillow system I know that will stay cool all night is SelectComfort with the material that runs either cool or hot air through pillows and mattress, but these cost like $ 3 Grand, so this is as good as it gets in its price range.Will update more later this week after a few more nights of sleep. :)3 WEEK UPDATE OF PILLOW NIGHTLY USE:After 3 weeks using the pillow, I had no choice but to buy a cheapie & thin 5-buck pillow at local store to place under this pillow. I have broad shoulders and I am a side-sleeping male, so the lack of thickness of this pillow and the fact that it is very soft (head sinks into it) formed me to do this. That is disappointing of such an expensive pillow (I am used to $15 pillows max).As for the cooling features, as stated before, it is cool for no more then 10-20minutes. Maybe I am just now used to it, but the cooling gel area seems much less effective as of late.All in all, it is a nice pillow if you sleep on your back. It is very soft and comfortable, but cannot be used by side sleepers, unless you are a 90lbs female. Males should take note and have a small pillow to place under it and test, as might have problems with neck and lower back pain if the two-pillow set-up is either too high and will have shoulder pain if 2-pillow set-up is not used.I reduced star rating from 3  --> 2 due to the fact that it is not a standalone product and price-usefulness has hurt its rating.',\n",

It puts out lots of air, and I feel the noise level is \"average\" for a fan.  A fan is going to make some noise if its putting out some air.  I would equate it to \"white noise\" in offices.

Well done!*****EDIT*****April 25, 2010  Now the supplier has taken down the wonderful example of the container you will receive and put the totally non-helpful picture back in it\\'s place.  I give up.*****EDIT*****January 22, 2013  I bought these bags again for the umpteenth time and received them today.  The packaging is different (no blue bag, no large yellow \"S\"; now white, black & red bag with red circle and white \"S\") and there is a small difference in the design of the bag.  Now there is a tab stuck onto the cardboard intake mounting which unfolds -- probably to help remove the full bag from the vacuum.  I don\\'t see much reason for this new addition but somebody evidently thought it was a good idea.  Also, the area around where the debris enters the bag has been reinforced and the center hole has already been punched. Now made in China instead of the USA.',\n",

       " 'B008VHXP9M': {'Best review': \"So back in Mar 2013 I moved into a house (apartment living before) and was excited to finally get a bigger trash can. Yay! No more tiny little basket under the kitchen sink ;-). While out shopping for one, I had every intention of buying a Simplehuman can - had one before and I like the look, like the stainless steel coolness - but wanted one with the step-on-the-lever-and-open-the-lid variety. Yep, that's what I really wanted because I love being able to open the lid hands-free, just using my feet.Unfortunately (or fortunately?) I took my daughter with me and she spotted this sensor can. I'll admit, I had fun playing with the store model (she did too, we didn't want to leave) and we took turns waving our hands over it and watching it open & close. Worked like a charm! And that's when I fell in love. But just like any new relationship, there were bumps ahead.I experienced the darn!-I-just-walked-by-you-and-you-opened phase (so I moved it) and the I-just-don't-feel-like-working-on-the-relationship phase in which I had to manually close the darn lid. Then came the I-should-have-bought-the-step-kind thoughts...I had to return this one. But because my daughter chose this sensor type and hey, why not give it another try? - I got another sensor can. This one worked much better! I still have the occasional what's-wrong-with-you-today! moments, but this trash can has trained me to hover my hand over the lid on every trash can -- then comes the moment of clarity that I'm not in my kitchen and this isn't my beloved can :-)So, most of the time it works, sometimes it doesn't (3 months later and I need new batteries), but I found I really like the sensor and worth the 6 C batteries and the occasional argh!-just-close-already! moments.\",\n",

The feel is wonderful. It\\'s almost like satin, but not nearly as slippery. One thing that I didn\\'t realize (and I don\\'t mind it, but others may not want it) is that only one side is the striped fabric. The other is a smooth satiny finish. This gives you a choice, but I expected both the top and bottom to be the same fabric. It\\'s quite nice either way, but some people are pickier.Anyway, I got the black, queen sized sets. (I buy 2 for my king-sized bed, because my hubby and I are both very \"active\" sleepers, and like to hog the blanket.) The color is really nice, deep, dark black. The stripes are very tasteful - more of an illusion than a color difference. The quality is very good with no fraying inside the cover, and the sham covers were big enough to fit my king-size down pillows, although they are very puffy. I am sure that they would be great with a standard pillow.These are definitely a great value for the price. They may not be Egyptian Cotton 600TC premium linens, but at 1/10th the price, they are a steal!EDIT: I just ditched these after less than a year.  I am leaving the 5-star rating though, because in many ways they are 5-star worthy. Here\\'s the thing. If you use your duvet like a bedspread, then this is a wonderful product. If, however, you use your duvet like a sheet/blanket combo (like Europeans do), then this may not be the best choice.  We found that the satin fabric, while soft and wonderful at the beginning, had a tendency to \"catch\" on dry skin. especially our feet. This eventually caused pulling and pilling, and that became really uncomfortable. When I tried a clothes shave it got even worse.So, I would say, if you have dry skin and you plan to use the duvet against your skin, this may not be the best solution. It\\'s a shame, because they still LOOKED really nice, as I put them in the trash! If you want them as a regular bedspread, with a top sheet, or for a guest room, then get these for sure!',\n",

It took me two hours to assemble just one, but then I was watching a movie and in no particular hurry to get it together.  After the base was assembled, and I got the hang of it, the assembly was pretty smooth.Aside from having to assemble the shoe cubby, I really like it and plan to order one more.  I think being able to customize the cubby holes to suit your space or shoe needs is a plus.  After the shoe cubby is assembled, it's pretty sturdy and doesn't wobble around like I thought it would, and it provides amble room for my size 8 shoes.  In some cases, like with flats, I can neatly place two pair of shoes in one cubby hole. The cubby holes will also accommodate small handbags.I bought two of these a few months ago, unfortunately, one of the boxes was missing 8 connectors.  I contacted the company, and they are shipping them to me.  If it looks like your box was previously opened, count the connectors, there should be 48.  The phone number for the company is on the directions which by the way are located in between the large panels.I think this is a worthwhile purchase in spite of having to assemble it.

It looks cheap, but from what I've seen of the price, that's not the case and the price seems to keep going up. After seeing the assembled product, I think I'd be disappointed if I paid what they're asking.I also don't think it will last long based on what I'm using it for. I have it where my kids do their crafts and it stores papers, glue, glue sticks, pens, pencils and scissors. My main concern is that the sides and top are white cardboard. How can one possible keep that clean? I'm not even going to try. From the get-go, I assumed it would get smudged with various things. That way I won't be disappointed when it's filthy after a few months around my kids and their crafts. My first thought however, when assembling this product, was would happen if the cardboard got wet? It seems like it would take just one sweating glass set on there to make the top swell and then fall apart. It hasn't happened with ours yet, but I fully expect it to at some point.There are some positive aspects to these cubes. Although the instructions are not overly specific (like which direction certain things go), they are easy to follow and most pieces snap into place. Once assembled, the unit seems quite sturdy, unlike a plastic storage drawer set I have (made by Rubbermaid). The magnetic closure on the door works well, keeping the door closed, yet it's easy to open. The plastic door is also sturdy as evidenced when a chair leg was pressing into the cabinet, bending the door, but not breaking it.It depends what you're looking for - it's uses and how pristine you want it to look in the long term. Yube furniture could be just the thing you need.\",\n",

I say &#34;for now&#34; because from most reviews I've read, the problems come after continued use. In my own opinion, the bed is sturdy, comfy to sleep on, & free of those awful squeaky noises that often accompany beds like these. It sits an appropriate height above the floor for plenty of under bed storage. The slats seem to be a good means of support & the metal looks to be of good quality. A few tips & notes if you're looking to buy:1) I noticed there are no extras of anything included with this bed. Keep up carefully with all materials, because if you lose any of it, you're up the creek until the company can send you replacements.2) Assembly time by yourself is going to range from 1 to 2 hours. Im a 23 year old female with plenty of experience in diy projects, but I have a bad back. This assembly is HARD on the back & neck, regardless of whether it's done sitting or standing. If you have arthritis or any bone disorder, I suggest getting help to speed up the process & avoid harming yourself.3) Another thing that slowed me down is I did not have any hex bits for my power drill. If you can, pick one up at the local Walmart. For only a few bucks, it would definitely speed things up.4) My weigh in on the controversy over whether or not you need a hammer or mallet, yes. You do. While using your hands to push the end caps on the slats into the frame is possible, it tends to bend the cap teeth, making it take longer to lock in. With the single tap of a mallet or *light* tap of a hammer, they go in much smoother.5) As for the reviewers saying their slats broke immediately, I find that ridiculous. One reviewer even said it was her child that broke the slats just by lying on it. All I can say is, Im 190 lbs. & I've slept on it two nights. No cracks. No breaks.....Take that how you will....6) Just an opinion. This is not a &#34;forever&#34; bed. Obviously, $95 for a queen bed is pretty cheap. It's basically just metal stilts under a thin metal frame with birch slats as a box spring. This isn't some $300-500 wooden bed that's extremely solid & will last. I bought this bed solely because it does not have foot or headboards & that really opens up my small bedroom. My point is, it'll definitely do until I can afford to move out of my parent's home & into my own home with a larger bedroom that can accommodate a larger bed. If you need a temporary solution (a few years at most) this is your bed. They'd make GREAT guest beds as well.\",\n",

But of course washing is especially critical in the bathroom, and that's when the backing turns into tiny white particles all over the mats and anything else in the load with them. So not only do I have little speckles all over my laundry, but although the mats still look good so far, I imagine that the backing won't last too long if it keeps getting washed away. So as much as I'd like to, I cannot recommend these mats with much enthusiasm.Update: I'm adding a star, because over time the laundering problem faded, and the mats are still holding up just fine after well over two years.

I hold my head in shame, the darn thing even put some rust marks on my china.Don't be cheap about spending the money, I am so glad I finally did it and am wondering what was wrong with me for not doing it sooner.

But, you do need tools to attach it to the wall and stabilize it. A stud finder is useful unless you know where the studs are in the wall or where they are absent to know how to screw space saver to the wall, which you will need a power drill to do. You'll also need a level and a hammer for this part of the job.Be sure to check with your apartment management, landlord, or house blue prints to be certain there are no pipes running behind your toilet. You don't want them punctured when drilling the screws into the wall. I assembled the unit and let the apartment complex maintenance man attach the unit to the wall to be on the safe side. I put the glass shelves in place after everything else was done.Hint: don't put the unit together until you get the bottom rear piece behind the toilet. Then build the unit around the toilet. Toilets are usually up against the wall with very little space between the two. Maybe enough for a sheet or two of paper? Otherwise, it's highly unlikely you'll get it into place.I'm very pleased with this unit. Really snazzes up the bathroom!\",\n",

I can carry it up or down stairs with one hand. The solution and recovery tanks are very easy to fill, install, remove, empty and rinse out.  They hold enough to clean a 10 X 12 bedroom that is lightly soiled.The suction is not as strong as a machine with a larger motor, but it is strong enough to pick up 90% of the cleaning water if you go back and forth over the saturated area repeatedly until you NO LONGER SEE WATER BEING DRAWN INTO THE RECOVERY TANK.

Haven't had it for very long, so I can't comment as to its durability over time. The reason I did not give it five stars is that the lanyard is not replaceable; it is attached directly to the unit from the inside. If it was attached with clips, then I could replace it with perhaps a slightly wider strap that would be more comfortable on my neck. Also, if the one provided were to break somehow, there is no way to replace it. Other than that, I expect to get a lot of relief from this little fan!UPDATE 9/15/2012: I've been using the fan for a couple of months now and still loving it. In fact, I just ordered a second one! With two, I can keep one in my purse and one out at home. With only one, I'm always afraid that if I remove it from my purse while at home, I'll forget to put it back and then be without it when I'm away from home. It really does provide wonderful relief for hot flashes. Unless you've experienced them, you have no idea how important that is!

It created even more room than I expected it would!My girlfriend saw a curvy shower curtain rod in a hotel and wanted one for our bathroom.  She said it would make a huge difference.  We have a pretty small shower stall in a small apartment bathroom.  I was skeptical.She did everything -- took the old rod down and installed this new one.  She used the old holes in the drywall as guides, so she didn't have to do much measuring.  It was really easy for her -- all she needed was a screwdriver and a drill.  It comes with everything else you need (drywall anchors etc).  I'm now a believer -- it's AMAZING how much extra room we have now!  I'm 6' tall with broad shoulders and have always felt cramped in our shower.  But now it's like we have a whole new shower!A great way to spend money since it impacts a part of our daily lives in a hugely positive way.A few specific notes:1.  About drill bit sizes:  the instructions say you need a 9/32&#34; (7mm) bit to install the drywall anchors.  We only have up to 1/4&#34;, so my girlfriend used that and just &#34;wiggled&#34; the bit around.  Worked great.  If you want direct stud installation, the instructions say you need a 5/32&#34; (4mm) bit.  Wood is different than drywall, of course, so maybe you actually need that size in this case.2.  Being fairly tall, I thought this rod might bother me in the bathroom -- since it curves away from the shower stall it's now in the &#34;open space&#34; of the bathroom, above the toilet.  She installed it high enough that it's not an issue, however, and after a few days I stopped noticing that anything was different.  Our shower curtain tucks away in the corner of the tub just like it did before, so basically nothing has changed in the convenience department.\",\n",

After a lot of hedging with Amazon's many choices, I decided on this one by Serta partly based on reviews, and partly because Serta leads the mattress field with their gel coolness technology.  On arrival the pillow was wrapped in clear plastic printed with the bold black Serta label, there was a Serta booklet enclosed, then 2 other pamphlets saying congratulations on your Sleep Innovations gel-infused memory foam pillow purchase, and warranty info from Sleep Innovations.  SAY WHAT?  I initially thought that a Sleep Innovations pillow was mistakenly sent in a Serta bag but no, the Serta booklet explained all - inside it says:&#34;Serta by Sleep Innovations - The Ultimate in Memory Foam Innovation.  Serta, one of the world's most recognized and trusted brand names, has partnered with Sleep Innovations to bring you a complete range of premium memory foam products...&#34;  Thereafter are photos of three different memory foam pillows including this gel reversible one, and two mattress toppers.  It seems this line is made exclusively for Amazon, which is a good thing as you're getting a better quality pillow than some of the prior SI gel pillows, which could be harder & more odorous (see reviews from BJ's).  What I received is a good quality, comfy, ventilated with air holes memory foam pillow of medium firmness, cushy yet supportive, with a firmer gel side that initially was pretty hard but again, one of the pamphlets explained why:&#34;when exposed to colder climates (it is winter in NY & courier left pillow outdoors) your pillow will become firmer, allow your pillow 24-48 hrs to renew its feel once placed in room temperature.&#34;  Also, this pillow had the barest trace of memory foam smell, which went away the next day after removing cover (a nice soft quilted 100% cotton cover w/ Serta label sewn on side).  I have to say, for this reasonable price, I'm happy with my new gel foam pillow and definitely notice a cooler sleep experience, no waking up with a sweaty neck.  Once again, Serta proves its reliability.\",\n",

Remember, I\\'m accustomed to fan based HEPA filters, so this is by far more quiet than any.As for the odor absorbency, this leaves a bit to be desired. It does work but not in a single pass manner. Many carbon filter manufacturers (the part of HEPA filters that scrub out odor) usually pride themselves on single pass efficiency. In other words the ideal goal is to eliminate 99.9% of odor on the first pass. I am a smoker so this becomes important to eliminate smell ASAP.On all settings, low, medium, high, the odor would be scrubbed about 85% out. For non smokers or low to moderate odor environments, this is probably good enough. The odor scrubber is simply a few strips of ultraviolet LEDs\\' that can be turned on and off, though I see no reason to turn it off. Ultraviolet light is the best odor absorber to date; however being LEDs\\' and the fact that a little odor remains tells me the LEDs\\' don\\'t put out true UV light, or are simply not powerful enough.Pros:Super quietEasy to clean, nearly fool proofDoesn\\'t get dirty too quicklyIt will dry the \"Truman cell\" ionizer prior to energizing it, so it doesn\\'t cause permanent damage.Nightlight that has 3 brightness levels (off, low, high)Remote controlCons:Odor absorbency could be better, but is adequate.I will update further if anything changes.',\n",

Let me give you some background information regarding my situation and use for this little machine...I have 5 cats in a three-story townhome and need to vacuum my place a couple of times a week. Once a month, I have a cleaning lady who does a more thorough cleaning (and uses the regular vacuum), but I still need to do some vacuuming a couple of times a week because the carpet ends up covered with cat hair, dust, etc.But I also work full-time and have about 2 1/2 hours of commute every day, so I really don't feel like spending the time vacuuming when I am home. That's why I bought this toy.CONS- To be honest, you should always have it running while you can keep an eye on it. The manual says it will learn the location and you only need to supervise it the first couple of times you use it, and it may very be that I will use it on different floors with different layouts alternatively so it doesn't get to learn the floor plan, but it has a tendency to get stuck on the same spots, so it's good to at least keep an ear on it while it works so you can come and rescue the little beast when it gets stuck.- Cleaning the equipment is a bit of a pain. It's easy to empty it, but cleaning the brushes is the part I am not so thrilled about...- Also, the cleaning isn't as thorough as what you get with a full-sized, regular vacuum cleaner.PROS- Even if you need to keep an eye (or ear) on it, you can let it run around while you are doing other things that you need to do yourself, like the dishes, watching TV, playing cards, working on your bills, etc.- It beats the heck out of having to pull the heavy and awkward vacuum cleaner out of the closet, drag it up and down the stairs and doing the vacuuming yourself!All things considered, it was a great investiment! I know it's $150, but I would be paying the cleaning lady more than that extra per month if I had her coming over every week, as I had at my other place because the mess of hairs just used to get out of control.Good luck!  :)\",\n",

In fact, after I placed the order I almost canceled it scared I might be the guinea pig for the item so to speak. I received them and was very impressed with how soft they were. I washed them immediately with detergent and fabric softener, and they very super soft. They get a 5 for softness. They also get a 5 for color, it was the right match. It is a sage that is not too light or too dark. They do lose a point though in quality. Instead of having an overlay of fabric at the end of the pillow, they have very small holes. I liked that because you will not feel it as much as standard pillow cases. However, they do not line up. I took a picture and added it to the photo gallery, please observe.For the price you really can't go wrong though. I am one that buys six pillows for my bed or needs extra cases for the guest room and it seems pillow cases alone can cost as much as a sheet set. I should know because the night I bought these I looked at 5 other online retailers and the lowest was 3 times the price, with shipping. Again, you can't go wrong with Amazon.Update February 16, 2011, I had this at 4 stars but am now giving it 3. I cannot believe how much hair gets stuck to these pillow cases. I do not have this issue with other pillows cases. I have to lint roll each one three times in the morning. The color is still great and the sage is soft. I see another reviewer bought 3 colors and it seems only the blue worked out, which is sad to read. I hope they improve the overall quality of these as I will not be buying more but am happy for what I bought them for.\",\n",

All of today's dustbusters have non-pleated filters which completely clog in a minute of two if dust is sucked up. Our old CHV9600's filter lasts so long, my wife didn't even realize it ever needed to be cleaned. We would go months before I'd clean it.Unfortunately, Black and Decker are now making much worse dustbusters with gimicks. No other dustbuster has a replaceable battery. Planned replacement cycle. In a few years you're forced to buy an inferior product from them again. Surprisingly, the competition hasn't made anything better either.This dustbuster, the SPV1800 does have a pleated filter, the VF20. Its pretty good, but not as good as the VF100 from the CHV9600. Still it can suck up lots of dust before it needs to be cleaned.This dustbuster overall seems very similar to the dustbuster we had in the early 2000's before our CHV9600.Pros: Its the only dustbuster with a pleated filter that can suck up a good bit of dust before clogging up.It has good suction, especially when the filter is clean. Some other current models have better suction, but only when very clean. Realistically, this one works much better.I love that it has a replaceable battery. Theoretically, the vac should last forever. Just replace the battery and filter. We've never had a dustbuster fail other than battery wearing out.Cons: Its expensive. Have to remove the battery to charge it up. No attachments. Our CHV9600 had crevice tool and brush which sorta work on this one. A big drawback is that you can't see in the compartment. Can't tell how full it is and can't tell what you've sucked up.We're also trying a FHV1200 portable vac which also has a pleated filter, but typical B&D;, the battery is not replaceable. No replacement battery is offered anywhere.\",\n",

I opened up the packaged and was overwhelmed by a very strong chemical smell, kind of like the smell of diesel or oil.  It is not a light scent, it was thick.  I washed them and it was still there, so I washed them again with baking soda and an extra rinse and it was faint but still there. They were also were thinner than I was expecting from the photo. I dried them and was going to put them in the box for return because of those two things (smell, thin)...but we needed sheets for the night because my others were still dirty and these were washed.  So I put them on the bed and we tried them out and doing that has changed my mind about returning them...they are so completely soft and warm.  My husband got in and said wow several times and then his exact words were \"this is like sleeping on a big pillowy cloud.\"  I normally wake up in the night freezing cold but these sheets kept me warm all night and they are so comfy and soft that I kept running my feet over them.  Neither of us wanted to get out of bed this morning because we were so cozy in the sheets.- Strong smell that you\\'ll have to get out before using- VERY soft and warm, feel great against your skin- I ordered sage, it is not the same color as in the picture it is a couple shades darker- Fits easily over the mattress with room to spare and I didn\\'t have to use my sheet clips that I normally do- Machine wash cold gentle cycle, tumble dry low- Fabric: 100% Microfiber Polyester- No problems with pilling or lint leftover in the washer- Made in China*UPDATE* I liked these so much I ordered another set, only in cocoa.  These came today and were so cheaply made that I had to return them. They also have switched the insert that comes in them to say Cozy Nightzzz instead of Elite Home. Everything else the same on the label except that. Stitching was torn or hanging loose, runs in them.  Extremely thin material and cheap.

After weeks of comparing, pricing, shopping online, I settled on this one (the one I originally started with)!Pros- 10 inch thick is just about right.  Not so thin that you can feel the slats of the futon, but not so thick it doesn't fold up into a sitting position on the futon- Color is about as advertised- Came vacuumed packed so it was easy enough for me to get upstairs to the guest room without any assistance- Firm enough so you are comfortable, but not so firm that it feels like you are sleeping on a slab of concrete.- Definitely thicker and more comfortable than a pull out sofa with a flimsy mattress.Cons- I definitely need to get a removable cover for it.  I have cats who love to lay all over it - so having something I can take off and wash would be a big plus!- There is a slight odor to it when you open it - but nothing so horrible it has to be sent back or I need to complain about it.  It is airing out nicely.- Not really a con, but it does take a few days to fluff up.\",\n",

So soft, in fact, that I don't doubt it would not hold in the heat very well without a blanket on top, although why you would not put a blanket over it is beyond me. It is very light, so it reduces the weight of the covers. This is good for people, like me, who have sensitive limbs and/or nerve damage and cannot tolerate a lot of blanket weight. But with your comforter on top of it, it holds in the heat very well. It gets very warm, and likewise reduces the temperature quickly when you turn the heat down. I was afraid I'd feel the cords because the material is so thin, but I don't feel them at all through my sheet. The controllers are nice and have long cords; longer than the Sunbeam blanket we just took off our bed. Overall, it is a much better electric blanket than our old Sunbeam. We'll just have to see how it lasts.UPDATE 12/30/12:  We have had this blanket 10 months now and are using it during our second winter with it. The only negative thing I can say is the material is a bit stretchy and somewhat difficult to pull up over my shoulders during the night. It seems to work its way down the bed towards the foot while we sleep and I have to pull it up the bed every morning when I make it. This is our 3rd electric blanket and the first to do this. I'm not sure why it happens. It's not long enough to tuck in at the end on our queen-size bed with a thick mattress, so we just had the corners tucked to keep it from moving up too far during the night. That appeared to have the opposite reaction and pulls it down every night while we sleep. We took the corners out today and we're just going to see what happens. I'd rather have it over my shoulders and and get pulled up every night and just move it down in the morning. However, we still love it. It heats quickly, and is so soft to the touch. It was still a wonderful buy.\",\n",

It is NOT a very high BTU heater that can alone heat up a large room or floor.  It is designed for supplemental heat.  We use it to successfully supplement our home gas heater system overnight, so that we can turn down the main house thermostat to about 62-64 degrees when we're asleep, and thus save money and energy on our gas bill while maintaining a higher temperature in our bedroom only.  It has 3 convenient power settings, and a working thermostat, and we find that even in low power position, enough heat is given off such that we can keep our 15' by 22' bedroom warm enough at night, even though our home's thermostat is down at around 62 or 64 degrees, instead of our normal 68 degrees during the day, when we obviously use other rooms in the house.  We never use high power, and find that low and medium power gives off ample heat for our purposes.  In addition, the thermostat works perfectly such that once adequate temperature has been achieved, it will turn off power temporarily for minutes at a time, thus saving energy, while the already heated oil within this radiator continues to give off heat!  Very efficient indeed.  Heaters like this one are an effective way to help save $$$ on your total energy bill during those cold winter nights.  Highly recommended.\",\n",

If you don\\'t want to read further, the overall point is that this product works well for what it is.  I\\'m pleased with the purchase and glad I did not buy one of the other brands.First, it is important to note that stand-alone air conditioners will never be as good as window units.  That is a fact.  However, there is often a need to buy these stand-alone units (such as in my case, where window units are banned in my apartment lease).I live in Detroit, which is not the hottest place is summer, but does get quite hot and humid nonetheless.  Overall, this product does cool off my bedroom, which is actually quite large.  Yes, it does take some time to do so (about an hour at the hottest times), but can run for a good 12 hours straight.  I run it on high, with the fan on high as well (they are separate controls), and my bedroom can get quite cold.There are some downsides, which are true of all these stand-alone units.  First, if you have \"non-standard\" windows (which will apply to most buyers), the directions tell you to cut the pvc window cover to fit.  That\\'s great if you know someone who has expertise in cutting through pvc.  I do not.  I ended up using styrofoam from the packaging to \"tweak\" the window cover to fit.  It\\'s not a great seal, and even has some spaces, but the unit still cools effectively.  So that\\'s a plus for this product.If you run the unit for 12 hours or more, you will need to empty it.  Water collects at the bottom and the unit will automatically shut itself off.  There is a spout at the very bottom, only about an inch off of the ground.  When you open it, water pours out.  To empty, you will need a cookie sheet.  I have not found anything else, other than a cookie sheet, that is thin enough to sit below the inch-high spout.  And I often have to put the plug back in, empty the sheet, then resume the process two to three times before it is empty.  Sometimes I will even balance the unit on the cookie sheet and tip it over slightly to get all of the water out.  This is a bit annoying, but I suspect it is the same with all stand-alone units.  And on the hottest of days, it\\'s really a small inconvenience for a nicely cooled room.Other than these issues, the unit works well.  It is definitely effective in cooling, (even a large and oddly shaped bedroom like mine).  The controls allow you to personalize the cooling temperature, the cooling output, and the fan.  It was also relatively easy to assemble (I had a few minutes of trouble figuring out the hoses, but I\\'m also a novice) and put in place.  It has wheels, so you can easily move it from room to room (but may have an issue if windows in different rooms are different sizes).  I think it\\'s one of the better stand-alone air conditioners.',\n",

With the old style mattress and box spring, the size would have been fine. The shams on the Queen size are small, also, so it would have been nice to have larger shams, but not a deal breaker. We put some older standard pillows in them, and they look fine. I love the look.

We ordered 3 of these 30 piece sets and just replaced *everything* with these since they use only 3 lids and they all nest.I love everything about them except two things:#1 the lids and containers have areas that collect water in the dishwasher, so when you get them out of the dishwasher they get everything else wet unless you're very careful and then require hand drying.#2 the fact that the lids snap together and can be snapped onto the bottom of the containers themselves is a neat idea, but in reality it means that the lids are designed in such a way that if you fill the containers even close to full the lid will no longer seal closed.  For instance, if you put half an avocado with the seed still in it in one of the smaller shallow containers, the seed sticks up to right at the top of the container...  normally that would be ok, but with these the lid won't close properly because of how it's designed.Other than that, well constructed, stackable, looks nice, very happy with these.\",\n",

Yay! The neutral color makes it unobtrusive, and blends in with any decor. It's also light weight, so it's easy to move around, yet very sturdy. It oscillates and tilts up and down. It's exactly what I was looking for and has every feature I wanted.Assembly Tips: The round part that screws down over the fan blades to lock them in is tightened counter-clockwise, which is backward from the usual way. Tighten till just snug, don't over tighten. Also, when attaching the grille, it helps to have a flat head/slot type screwdriver to push the tabs in, and also for removing the grille for cleaning.Note: The year before I had purchased theHoneywell HT800 Super Turbo High Performance Fan, Blackin white, and it was so noisy I couldn't stand it. I wish I had found the Lasko fan then!Bottom Line: I love the fan so much, I bought a second one for the bedroom a few weeks later.P.S. Usage Tip: I also got this remote switchSuper Switch Wireless Remoteso I could set the fan across the room, and be able to turn it on and off from the bed. Not out of laziness, but if halfway through the night you feel cold/hot, you don't have to rouse yourself out of bed, or disturb your partner.

My husband recycles everything - dead Christmas lights are stripped for copper wire and much more. All of these bits and pieces go into containers until he has enough to take to our recycling center. He works at a table in our basement family room and I was always moving boxes and containers from the floor and seating areas. This is the perfect solution. We can roll this to his table to work with; it also has room for his art supplies and then it rolls back to a space behind our couch.With an 80 lb. weight limit for the top and 25 lb. for the lower shelves, there is no problem even holding heavier bolt cutters. The unit shelves are smooth and sturdy.He put the unit together by himself in an hour and 30 minutes. It does say you need 2 people, but the only help he needed was to carry it. You need to follow the well written instructions, especially assembling it on a rug so that the smooth surfaces do not get scratched. There are no tools included, but all you need is a hammer, a regular screwdriver and a Philips screwdriver. We also used a drill to use all the caster screws.The only problem came when it was time to attach the 5 casters, one is in the middle. There are 4 holes on each caster unit. There were screws included to use in the 4 holes, but the unit itself only had 2 holes drilled in it. The casters seemed okay with 2 screws, but we drilled our own holes anyway to fit all 4 screws.It is a handsome, simple unit, it rolls well. And the casters do have brakes, which especially for the middle one would be hard to lift the latch up and down when the unit is in use. I would not want to have a TV on top and have this rolling around, so the brakes are useful.\",\n",

It also seems a bit sturdier.The only &#34;negative&#34; about this bed is that it takes a good amount of pull to raise the top of the bed all the way up in order to return it to the flat position.  This is not an issue for me because I leave the head of the bed slightly elevated even to sleep, eliminates the need for my usual mountain of pillows!  Even with arthritis I am able to make the manual adjustment however, I believe shorter folks might struggle with this.  Otherwise a terrific and affordable version of an adjustable bed.\",\n",

I saw one reviewer, Gina, recommend not pushing it so far that it collapses, but that doesn't work for me -- it doesn't do anything then.=== (2)  The orange &#34;vortex force clog breaker&#34; seemed like a good idea, but it didn't work for me.  The only effect I noticed was that it made the whole plunger harder to clean.  (Its threads hold onto all the dirty stuff much more than the smooth rubber, and took a lot of work to clean off.)  Also, this orange part came off completely, and got accidentally flushed down the toilet.  I think it made the problem a bit worse for a little bit, since it probably had a hard time working its way through the plumbing.  And the little socket where the orange &#34;vortex force clog breaker&#34; used to be now collects dirty stuff more than the rest of the smooth plunger.So, all in all, I can't recommend this to anyone else.\",\n",

It definitely weighs less than my laptop -- and that's incredible for a vacuum.  Just at 7lbs according to my scale.When the box arrived I thought it had to be a mistake. I knew it was supposed to be light but the UPS guy handed it to me with one hand and was holding out his signature pad with the other. It weighs nothing.Unpacking it was super easy. There are no attachments. This is a floor vacuum and that's it. It would be awesome for professional cleaning services who need power but who have to haul things around. Also would be perfect for someone who is elderly. Anyway, I unpacked it, popped the handle on and it was ready.There is a cloth-like bag inside already and I'm pretty sure you can reuse that a time or two before needing to purchase replacement bags. (The bags are currently cheaper on Amazon than at the Oreck site). The cord is really long so that's a huge bonus. I hate getting halfway across the room and BAM the vacuum shuts off and I've bent the prongs on the plug unknowingly in a cleaning frenzy.The first place I decided to test this was my son's room. I have no idea how he gets so much crap in there and tiny pieces of stuff everywhere. He also must walk through something repeatedly and track it back and forth so that the nap of his carpet by the door is kind of not sticky, but grimy and beaten down -- we have relatively new carpet. This little powerhouse shocked me! The carpet gave up a lot of stuff my old vacuum could never, ever have gotten out. His carpet looks all fluffy and new. I was about to have the carpets professionally cleaned but instead was inspired to just get some vinegar and scrub up a couple of stains he's created and voila! It looks fresh and new.The vacuum lays completely flat so I was able to vacuum up dust bunnies and hair clumps from our dog without having to move the bed or even strain. It just lays down and goes all of the way across the bed, as far as my arm will reach.I am quite surprised by the high performance of this relatively quiet, amazingly light vacuum. I was honestly afraid after Hoover bought them out of bankruptcy last year that Oreck quality would end up like every other great product in a Walmart world. If this is any example, that hasn't happened yet.As an aside -- I also have a Dyson Animal and by comparison, which is difficult because these are completely different types of vacuums, I would say this has equal suction. The Dyson of course comes with a tool for everything and doesn't have a bag. If you don't need all of the attachments, animal grooming tools, hoses, little brushes, then I would DEFINITELY choose this one, simply for the convenience and portability.\",\n",

At first I wasn\\'t sure if should get this or a space heater that works with oil inside of it; but I\\'m glad I got this one instead. It couldn\\'t be easier to set up--just take it out of the box and plug it in! Although you should read the four pages of instructions in order to be familiar with general precautions and to know how to use the timer feature and a couple other extra features, it amazed me just how intuitive it is to get this thing up and running.In addition, it\\'s easy to lift--it\\'s very lightweight, especially after you remove it from the box; and there\\'s a neat timer function so that you can \"program\" this to turn off at a set time up to 8 hours in advance. Great! The machine also turns on or off automatically depending on how close it is to making your room the exact temperature you specify by pressing the plus and minus buttons to set temperature.After you turn it on, be aware that within 20 to 30 seconds you\\'re going to feel the heat begin to blast upward from this unit, so don\\'t get too close to the top of it after you turn it on. Another cautionary note, at least according to the instructions, is that the device can possibly leave a permanent stain on hardwood or similar floors. If this is a concern for you, keep looking for another portable space heater. My carpeting is practically industrial strength and I have plenty of extra pieces of the carpeting in one of my closets so I personally am not too concerned about any staining that may or may not result from my using this heater.Overall, this is a great little heater that pleasantly surprised me when I realized just how powerful it really is. Although it\\'s not for everybody (i.e., people with hardwood floors may want to stay away) it suits me fine and I recommend it for heating rooms up to roughly 300 square feet especially when the floors are not hardwood.',\n",

And though I loved it, it's time had come.When this arrived it had been sealed into a vacuum bag and required 48-72 hours laid out to reshape itself.  Luck for me I had a spare bedroom to lay the thing on or I don't know what I would have done.  Also it has a foul chemical odor straight out of the bag.  After the 48 hours had gone by the mattress had fluffed up and the odor was gone.  Now when I first placed this on top of my pillow top, my bed was now so high that I had to jump to get on it.  So the following day I removed the pillow top and placed this directly on my box spring.  Now my bed sits extremely low to the ground with this only being 8 inches thick.  This places me within range of the dogs who up until now could not make the jump onto the bed.  Now I am not opposed to a dog sleeping at the foot of my bed, but when my alarm goes off in the morning - I am at the perfect height for early morning sloppy kisses which makes the snooze button pointless.As far as comfort, this is a very nice firm mattress that I actually sleep very well on.  I would recommend it to people who enjoy a firm mattress.  I don't know how well it would hold up over time if I was a heavier person (I am about 115lbs).My only wish is that this was higher because I'm not a fan of sleeping so low to the ground.

The hooks are similarly shallow, but as long as you\\'re only hanging scarves, coats with strong hanging hoops, and bags with good hanging hoops, you should be fine. Again, it\\'s solid, too, so you don\\'t worry at all about loading it up.You only mount this puppy once (well, hopefully), but it will be memorable. Again, it\\'s heavy. I mounted it alone, but I would recommend another person help you, along with a sturdy step stool and appropriate tools. I had a stud-finder and a drill, which helped. However, the holes in the French cleat (love that this was the mounting approach, but) did not align with the studs. I had to drill my own hole in the cleat in order to optimally place the unit.Anyway, reading back over the reviews I read before I bought it, I have to say they were right, and my review pretty much comes across the same as theirs. At this price, it\\'s nice enough, it requires no real \\'assembly\\', and it\\'s probably worth the trouble, even if it is a bit shallower than most of us would prefer.',\n",

It fit my neck perfectly and cradled my head in the ideal position for sleeping. The material is soft and certainly not scratchy or uncomfortable like some of the less expensive pillows tend to be. Plus, I've had an issue with seams leaking air in the past, and 24 hours later, this pillow is still fully inflated. A handy pouch makes for easy storage in between uses.Given that, my daughter tried it too. She's a very petite teen with a long, slender neck. It was too loose on her neck, and therefore, didn't support her head as well. That's the only thing keeping me from giving this 5 stars. The pillow simply didn't work well for her size/shape. I think the comfort you experience is going to depend on the size and length of your neck.\",\n",

However, the outlets in other countries are also different shapes, so you will need a set of adapters, or at least one for the country you are visiting, and no adapters come with this unit.  Of course many people who travel overseas already have adapters, so that may not be an issue for you.  The only odd thing about this unit is that it says using distilled water will damage the unit.

I took a chance and I was darn wrong.If a \"thermometer\" is off by a few degrees in whatever scale, you cannot \"legally\" (in my book) call it a thermometer.  It is a defective product.  And from the reviews, this is a rare product that has more defective units than functional ones.To avoid the hassle of returning it, I was trying to savage something out of it for monitoring our well sheltered outdoor pet house.  I ended up showing you how defective the product is.  I took the temperature of the pet house over a day, comparing the readings with a side-by-side portable Honeywell thermostat used to control the central air condition system.To be called a thermostat, it has to be reasonably consistent or the air con system will go crazy on and off.  In addition, 72 deg is the most common setting, whereas 76 will be hot in comparison.  You cannot have people in the whole market with very different experience for the same temperature setting.The 1st chart compares the readings throughout the day.The 2nd chart focus on the errors, from spot on to 8 degs difference, mostly 4 degs.The 3rd chart shows the classic sensor hysteresis curve.  The reading depends on the current temperature as well as well as the past.They use a cheap raw sensor to read the temperature directly without any compensation. Perhaps it may be useful for plants to detect frosty temperatures that I did not test.  This is totally useless for human and animals.  I\\'m going to replace it with another brand that claim an accuracy within 2 degs.',\n",

I have been told time and again at doctor's office visits to use a humidifier every night. This Vornado Evap3 is not really a bedroom unit (unless you have a very large bedroom) and its generally a little on the noisy side for nighttime use. That said, I tried it in that capacity anyway and with the unit set on &#34;low&#34; I found the noise level to be acceptable. This is going to be highly subjective. Set on &#34;high&#34; it felt too noisy even for a living room/parlor environment. I can't stand having too much moisture in the air, so the &#34;high&#34; setting is also (in my very subjective opinion) too much even in a larger room.As for the wick filters, they do require regular changing as they will mildew over time. It's a pain, quite frankly, and an expense I'm not sure I will want to endure for very long. Basically, humidifiers are a pain in the back to deal with and all of them have their pros and cons. I just don't want to have to buy wick filters every month and worry about making sure to get the right size and hunt for the best price.The water level in the tank is easy to determine at least, and a full tank lasts a good 24-hour period. Like with any humidifier, keep it clean. Be meticulous about this. It has to become part of your routine, as these are not maintenance-free items. And be prepared to change the filters. The Evap3 is relatively lightweight for its size and is basically easy to operate. It performs well and seem like a fair value for the price for those wanting something larger than a unit that can sit comfortably on a nightstand or desk.\",\n",

Just got off the phone w/Sauder, and they are shipping me out a replacement top shelf today!This would've gotten a review of 4 except for the damage. The unit arrives in Sauder's packaging only, which is quite sturdy and protective, but non-reversible, so that once you unpack this thing, you're not going to package it back up in the original packaging if you need to send it back, so I am keeping it as is. The damage clearly didn't happen in shipping, there was no sign of any shipping distress on the package at all, so the damage happened prior to pr during packaging at the factory. What I have is a vey visible, crescent shaped crack in the laminate on the top surface the TV sits on, on the right side front corner. If it was in the back or on a lower shelf I wouldn't care.As I said, if this weren't the case I'd give this a 4. Sure, it's laminated particle board, but it goes together reasonably quickly -- I put it together in 1.5 hours taking my time, and when together it is very sturdy and looks pretty good. I'm not sure how long the finish will last as others have said it scratches easily, but if I get a few years out of it I'll be happy, although I'd be happier if it didn't come pre-damaged.One other nit-pick I have is that the laminated doesn't cover the edges of the back edges on the top cover, the part that's angled to fit in a corner. This isn't a big deal if you're using this  as intended -- as a corner stand -- but if you wanted to use it against a wall then you'd be looking at a strip of exposed particle board contrasting against the dark laminate about 3 inches long on each side.\",\n",

       " 'B000L1IXAW': {'Best review': 'We have a new house, just built this past year, 2012. This item fits our doors perfectly. So I am guessing that our doors are the \"standard\" type of doors. I have read several reviews for similar items, and I decided to go with this one. I am happy that I made the right decision.My husband\\'s job requires him to wear a uniform, a utility belt, a vest, and other gear. We have a closet in a room on the first floor at the back of the house where he keeps his uniforms. Half of that closet is where I keep my shoes and purses. He likes to prepare his stuff the night before so that he will not have to spend time looking for stuff the next morning. He is responsible and efficient like that. His routine is to hang his uniform for the next day on the doorknob outside the door on his side of the closet. As for me, this annoyed me because when I want to open my side of the closet, his uniform and the hanger are barricading the door. I cannot open my side of the closet because his uniform, or the hanger that had his uniform, was still hanging on the doorknob of the other door. I had to take the uniform off the door, put it somewhere, get my shoes, then close the door and put back his uniform. It is an extra step for me to do and it was very annoying because he was being inconsiderate. My solution then was to stick a large 3M Command Hook on the inside of the door on his side of the closet so that he can hang his chosen uniform where it will not be in the way of opening the door. That worked for a while. It still works until now, but then he started hanging things outside the closet door that in the entryway close to the front door.  There was an over-the-door wreath hanger on the closet door that I hung there temporarily after the holidays and then forgot about it.  So he started using that as his temporary hook in case he needed to hang something by the front door. This was an eye sore. Yes the wreath hanger serves the same purpose but it does not look nice. He says, \"This will do for now.\" But this is not a dorm or apartment where you know your stay is temporary. We have a nice new house and things like this will just not do.So then my search began for the perfect over-the-door hook....I wanted something that looked nice and presentable especially if it is for the entryway area. So this disqualified all the plastic hooks from consideration. I focused on polished chrome or satin nickel hooks. I read so many reviews and decided on this one. It looks good, better than the photo. It has some weight to it, so I know it will not bend easily and will be able to hold a few items of clothing on hangers if necessary. When we received the package (Amazon Prime, 2-day shipping), I asked my husband to place the hook on the door to give him some participation (he is way taller anyway). So the hook fit perfectly. Not too big, and not tight. It was just right.  Measurements were exactly as described.  Also, it looks good. It doesn\\'t look like something you would buy for a dorm room or an apartment.  When you have a house, you would want to buy things that are nice and good quality.  I will buy more for our bedroom doors.If you are deciding to get this, make sure you check the measurement of your door and compare it to the measurement of the opening of this hook. The measurement in the product description is pretty accurate.  Hope this review helps.',\n",

The disadvantages are that the vacuum is loud, it's tough to use the hose with attachments (you have to bend down and disconnect one hose and attach another hose) and the handle doesn't lower fully for vacuuming under a coffee table.Still this is an excellent value for such an inexpensive machine and it's cleaning ability is amazing!

Its small size will stay out of the way from other items. The casing is flimsy since the metal housing is made of very thin, soft metal; so you can't be abusive with it.The great part about the dry pack is that it is reusable. Once it absorbs too much moisture, I can just put it in the oven on low heat and it will dry out and be ready for the next use (unlike the small paper silica packs).

I never had any problems getting my apartment clean very quickly with that basic setup, and I think for most people it stops there. If you don\\'t have a specific problem (like pets), chances are you won\\'t need this extra attachment.But in my case, things changed when we got a Persian cat. The carpets would all of a sudden completely refuse to get clean! Worse even, after a few swipes, the hair ended up being arranged into thick threads that then stubbornly stuck to the carpet, requiring me to disconnect the floor tool, and take in the thing with the hose. What it came down to is, I spent 15 minutes per carpet and not really getting it clean - very frustrating.Cue this product, which helped tremendously! You have to move rather slowly on the carpet to let the brushes do their work, and sometimes lift it up so that the brushes can spin up again. It\\'s still not completely effortless, but it does get the carpets very clean within reasonable time. It\\'s quite a sanity- safer.The reason I\\'m withholding one star is because there is no way to turn off the brushes. They\\'re always on, and making quite a ruckus on hardwood floor. Suction is permanently reduced as well, and the fast/slow switch works by opening a hole on the top, making things even worse. Because of all this, I find myself switching floor tools. It would be so much nicer if Miele had found a way to stop the brushes without reducing suction.Another small negative (but not enough to downgrade my opinion of it) is that it doesn\\'t come apart easily for cleaning. One has to unscrew two plastic screws and even then the brush stays in. By comparison, the brush on my Roomba comes out completely with just a yank.',\n",

I have innerspring and memory foam mattresses in my home and my son has always preferred the memory foam beds so I was excited to have the opportunity to try this mattress.If this is your first memory foam mattress, you\\'ll notice it arrives rolled and compressed into a relatively compact size box, but is quite weighty for it\\'s size. To allow it to expand, take the still rolled and compressed mattress to the bed frame or box spring you\\'ll be using it on before opening it. CAREFULLY slit the plastic (without cutting the mattress or cover) and the mattress will immediately begin expanding into shape. DreamFoam, like virtually every other memory foam mattress manufacturer, suggests waiting 24-48 hours before sleeping on it to allow for full expansion, however, my son slept on it the first night.This is an 8\" mattress and mine actually measures slightly over 8\". The cover is a plush, white, knit velour which is carved into a gorgeous pattern of roses. I was also completely surprised to find two, standard size memory foam pillows included! They are covered in the same white velour fabric, but the pillow is made of shredded memory foam chunks. I have to say I LOVE these pillows! They are so much more comfortable for me than those small, strangely shaped, solid-slab memory foam pillows.There is a slight odor to the mattress and somewhat more of an odor to the pillows upon opening the packaging. Because I have a sensitive nose, I opened the windows in the bedroom for the first day and the smell dissipated quickly.This mattress is what I would consider soft. I have a firm memory foam mattress that I sleep on and this one is much, much softer, while still being completely supportive. This is the least expensive mattress I have in my home and after sleeping on it myself one night, I\\'m shocked to find that the quality rivals the most expensive memory foam bed I have! This was a huge surprise to me. I always assumed that in bedding, you get what you pay for but in this case, price is not a measure of quality.

This is not a vacuum for everyone, as the weight will make it uncomfortable for some people to use, expecialy if one has stairs, as dragging the vacumm up and down them isn't going to be too easy.  The vacuum weight nearly 18 pounds and I find it much to heavy.I have to admit that I had a lot of expectations for this vacuum cleaner, but it didn't live up to them. Immediately after cleaning the carpet, I decided to vacuum again with my Shark Navigator (which costs less than half of the price of the Samsung). Imagine my surprise when I noticed how much dirt the Samsung MotionSync Bagless Upright Vacuum left behind.The next thing that I'd like to write about is a detachable hand vacuum, which is designed to serve us as helpful in reaching the hard-to-reach areas using attached accessories. Unfortunately, these accessories do not come with a vacuum cleaner. The only tool that is included, it's a fine nozzle. I can't imagine using the manual vacuum cleaner longer than 5 minutes. It is very heavy and not suitable for extended housework.The manufacturer claims it is easy to maneuver thel vacuum -- but  I can not agree with this. The cambered and hollow wheels don't make it easy to push at all. Just moving it forward isn't an easy task.  During vacuuming is much easier to push, but swifting from side to side is not as easy as vacuumes I have had the oportunity to use.Another thing I don't like is the lack of option to set the height of the carpet. While the vacuum cleaner performs well on low carpets and hard floors, it has huge difficulties in moving on slightly higher carpets.On the positive side, it is a very solid vacuum.  Each part of the vacuum perfectly matches the rest of it.  The buttons for turning on and off the unit or brush were installed at the height of the palm of your hand, so there is no need to bend down.  Furthermore, I really like the dust tank , which is esay to empty with just one hand.  Also, I really like the long cord which is almost 30 feet, which makes it easy to work without finding a new outlet.In conclusion, I would not recommend this vacuum cleaner to elderly people because of its weight. In itself it isn't bad, but for this price you can get something much better.\",\n",

It\\'s not what I\\'d call quiet, but, it\\'s not what I\\'d call really noisy either (to me it sounds like a box fan). Though, as another reviewer stated there\\'s no drainage holes, so it does make a little noise when the water pools.It\\'s easy to install and comes with all the screws, foam strip and little brackets so, if you have a Phillips head screwdriver you should have everything you will need when you get home to install it.  It\\'s very easy to use as well.Overall, a nice little a/c that cools nicely.UPDATE 6/9/11: This is still working nicely for us, though, we started running a fan about 5 feet from this to \"pull\" the cool air down (as it blows up) as we have very high ceilings and that really helps it actually not only cool down our living room but, our kitchen as well. We have an open floor plan in our home with high ceilings and so far with the fan set up while this a/c is running has been keeping us more than cool enough.If you want an a/c that\\'s going to \"freeze\" you out this little a/c probably isn\\'t for you.

It\\'s a slightly flexible, on the thin side, plastic (old style was heavier, thicker, and much more flexible, like rubber(maid).)It also appears that there is a frame wrapping all the way around the bottom (inset)so it may be harder for air to get under there and dry things out. Other than that I think the rest of my review stands.Honestly, after checking out the prices (call it the price jump) on the other brands I think that Rubbermaid\\'s products may not be made as sturdily as they used to be but for the price I\\'d say the quality (compared to the Euro-crap out there) is an awesome value.ORIGINAL: I\\'ve had one of these for 4-5? years.Yes, it drains from the long side. The picture at the time I am writing this clearly shows this.  At first I didn\\'t like this side-ways configuration; then I realized that it takes up less counter space. It uses space more efficiently.  So now I have enough room for my knife block set. Win, win!It also has a ramp built into it that tilts it towards the sink and I have found that it drains water much better than the old style did. Plus any water that gets underneath the tray dries up pretty quickly due to the air space created by the built-in ramp. I have NEVER had any kind of mold or mildew problem with this tray and I am BAD about keeping an eye out for water under the tray. My tray stays on the counter 24/7.The drain-lip does not extend beyond the edge of the tray (the portion that the rack sits on) but I found that if you push the tray just beyond the edge of the sink it drains fine.  Note: 1. This does take away from the available space of the sink because the rack moves down too (along with the tray) and gets in the way. Also,the feet of the rack (also Rubbermaid)have made a slight indentation in the tray which traps a tiny puddle of water. Not awful but it does require me to clean the tray more frequently than I normally would. I anticipate that in time (A few years) this indentation MIGHT turn into a crack but I\\'d have replaced it before then just because well...how long can one woman stand the same drain tray?I am shopping for drain racks today and if I purchase a rack that is compatible (size, style and color etc.) with my current drain-tray I will might continue to use it. If not I\\'ll definitely keep it to use as a backup for holidays etc.',\n",

Although the rubber feet make it more difficult to attach one on-top the other when stacking.  Just need to push it into the slit of the rack below.  It doesn't snap but the weight of the bottles / gravity keeps it firmly down / in place.  I might get a third to put on top of the two.

It would be a perfect gift for a young person moving into their first apartment or a newlywed couple getting their first home! I live in a cabin and love the neutral brown colors. It fits in nicely with my decor but also has a bit of a feminine touch- which I really like to have in a bathroom.The rugs are VERY soft! They feel like carpet! And I really love stepping out of the bath and onto them. They're quite comfy. But I was expecting them to be a bit bigger. The toilet rug is extends only about 12 inches from the base of the toilet- which really doesn't cover much room. The other rug is decent in size, but still isn't nearly as big as I thought it would be by judging from the picture. I would estimate it's about 24 inches across and 13 inches wide.The shower curtain is not cloth- although they say it is. It's plastic, but even so it looks very pretty. The design is subtle and looks very 'Ancient Rome' in the design. I find it very pretty! The tan and brown also are nice because they don't get dirty as quickly as white does. The shower curtain rings were covered in the same exact fabric as the curtain. Some of them were a bit frayed. And the rings didn't seem too sturdy. I might end up using my old ones, because I fear these ones just won't hold up. But they do look nice.The towels are light-weight. They're definitely not for every day use. But they do look lovely as a decoration. They are very soft and would make nice hand towels. It comes with one full size bath towel, one hand towel, and one wash cloth. The design you see on the edge is actually the same material as the shower curtain (sort of a plastic fabric), so although it looks lovely it isn't really functional. I'm also a bit worried that the white color will get grungy fast, but I've only had them hanging for a week, so time will tell. They do add a nice accent to the towel holder though. For a guest bathroom I think they would be beautiful.All in all, for the price I am quite pleased. I wish it were all a bit better quality, but I can't complain. It does look very pretty and I look forward to using it until it wears out. Love the softness of the rugs and the design of the curtain!\",\n",

Next, when I went to open the package of the small scented card that was attached to the bag per the instructions, it fell off of the bag.  It smelled nice so I just stuck in the vacuum with the bag.  Installing the bag in my Hoover Windtunnel T-series was a cinch.I personally do not like the scent of the bags.  It bothered me so much that after vacuuming about 600 square feet of carpet, I tossed the bags because they made me nauseous and gave me a headache.  After having read the other reviews on this product, I'm convinced that there's a problem with consistency for this product.  It's funny to me that some people had bags without much scent.  Not the case here!  The scent of the bags even lightly lingered in the basement that I had vacuumed for about an hour.A strong scent like this might be a plus for smoking households or those with indoor pets.  It's just not for me and it's a shame for people who want that strong smell, that it sounds like not everyone gets bags as strongly scented as mine.  I'd have to agree that it's best to stick with the bags made by Hoover.  They really are of better quality.  Get your scent fix in another way.\",\n",
