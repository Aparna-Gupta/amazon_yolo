The pan allows for replicating the authentic flavors of grilled, fried, toasted, broiled, baked, boiled, sauteed, or steamed foods in the convenience of a microwave oven, while eliminating odors, spatters, and the wasted time and energy required to heat a conventional oven. Use the pan for making anything from scrambled eggs, sausage, breakfast toast, crispy bacon, and boiled eggs in the shell (without bursting) to steak, roasted salmon, flavored rice, chicken nuggets, and more. The pan works by preventing electromagnetic waves from penetrating food, which causes food to dry out, and instead converts the electromagnetic waves into far infrared energy for cooking. The result: moist and mouthwatering meats (no defrosting required), good-as-new leftovers, and appetizing snacks throughout the day. Specially constructed of high-heat-resistant SPS plastic with low heat-conductivity, the unit remains cool and retains its shape even during cooking and after multiple uses.

Enjoy fresh, single cup coffee, with each brew. No more stale or burnt coffee that was made hours ahead. Brew only what\u2019s needed for less waste. The pour-over coffee method is a time-tested technique, developed in Japan, that allows complete control over the quality and flavor of brewed coffee, one delicious cup at a time. Pour-over coffee, also known as hand pour, is a method of brewing coffee by pouring a thin, slow, steady stream of water over the ground coffee. Practiced by coffee lovers worldwide for the distinct, flavorful results, it requires water at a precise temperature, fresh, high-quality beans at the right grind, slow and even water flow, and patience during the brew time. HIC\u2019s Filter Cone is how to make good coffee the pour-over coffee way. For a perfect brew, preheat the Coffee Filter Cone by rinsing it with hot water, then place it over a mug or carafe. Insert a paper or reusable coffee filter and measure in medium-grind coffee, or grind whole beans fresh (approximately 2 rounded tablespoons of ground coffee per 8-ounces of water, or to desired taste). Using just-boiled water, wet all of the grounds slightly and let wet grounds stand to bloom coffee for 15 to 30 seconds. When grounds mix with water, they expand slightly and release more flavor. Slow and precise water flow is critical to extracting the most flavor with this pour over coffee technique. Pour the remaining hot water, slowly and evenly, from the center of the grounds outward, in a circular motion. Allow the porcelain coffee dripper to finish dripping. Total brew time should take about 2 \u00bd minutes. Remove the red coffee filter cone from the mug and discard the wet grounds. Drink the fresh-brewed coffee immediately. HIC\u2019s Porcelain Filter Cone makes a perfect coffee accessories gift for at-home baristas and coffee enthusiasts.

For over 100 years, Victorinox Commercial Cutlery has become the tool of choice for professionals, and the brand continues to innovate with the introduction of the new ceramic blade collection featuring proprietary Fibrox\u00ae handles. Ceramic blades have recently gained popularity due to their outstanding edge retention and resistance to corrosion and acids.  Our ceramic blades are manufactured from high-purity zirconium oxide powder, compressed at very high pressures and sintered in furnaces at temperatures over 2700\u00b0 F. The result is an extremely hard blade that is comparable to the hardness of a diamond. Each knife is then equipped with our classic Victorinox Fibrox handle with signature textured grip, helping reduce the chance of slippage. And with the handle designed to minimize wrist tension while still providing legendary cuts, it\u2019s no wonder that Victorinox Commercial Cutlery remains the true choice of professionals. Ceramic blades are as useable as metal blades. Ceramic knives have several distinguishing features.  Precision Sharpness: We compress materials at very high pressures resulting in a hard blade which is comparable to diamonds. This hardness allows us to apply an edge with microscopic precision. The edge will maintain its razor sharpness and is resistant to wearing. No Odors: Ceramic material is not very porous; it keeps the blade from transferring odors from one food item to another. You can cut something spicy, give it a quick rinse and then cut something else. The spiciness won\u2019t transfer to the next food item. Sanitary: Ceramic blades are very dense, with very little pores. Just like your face, the less pores there are, the less dirt and grime can get into the pores. A quick rinse in warm water will get your ceramic knife a lot cleaner than a thorough scrubbing on a metal knife. Light Weight: Ceramic material is very light weight; half the weight of steel. The lighter weight means there will be less strain on your arms and shoulders. You can tackle any food preparation task with ease and precision, just like a pro. No Rust: Because metal is not used in ceramic knives, they will never rust. This makes them the perfect knives for humid climates where risks of rust are high.     Chef\u2019s Knife Santoku Knife Utility Knife Knife Sharpener   6-Inch Chef's: The most important tool and essential to every cook, a chef\u2018s knife is most often used in a rocking method to mince, dice, and chop vegetables and herbs. This one is known as the chef\u2019s best friend.  7-Inch Santoku: This knife combines the features of a cleaver with a chef's knife. The curved blade helps the rocking motion used for chopping, and the wide blade works well for scooping sliced food off a cutting board and for crushing garlic. The santoku can also be used to slice meat and has a narrow spine for making thin cuts.  Utility: An all-purpose knife often referred to as a sandwich knife, the utility knife peels and slices fruits and vegetables, and even carves small meats.  Ceramic Sharpener: The Victorinox Diamond knife sharpener with stand is specifically engineered for the care of Victorinox ceramic cutlery. The sharpener panel has diamond particles and the stand on which the knife should be placed sets the blade at the correct angle for sharpening.   The benefits of Fibrox handles  Our Fibrox handles are created with the unique hygienic needs of the home chef. They are designed to minimize wrist tension while providing a secure grip. They are also sanitary and easy to clean. They feature a lifetime warranty against manufacturer\u2019s defects.  How should I care for my ceramic cutlery?  After use, clean ceramic knives with a mild detergent. Dishwashing is not recommended, unless the knife can be guaranteed not to come into contact with any other product. Never clean with a wire brush or hold in an open flame. We recommend the use of a special diamond sharpener like our Victorinox Ceramic Diamond Sharpener. Store your ceramic knives in the supplied protector.  Who is Victorinox? Although Victorinox is known the world over as the creator of the Original Swiss Army Knife, the company started out in 1884 as a cutlery workshop.

Adams' wooden kitchen items feature renewable and sustainable wood in Maple, Cherry, Walnut, Alder, Ash, or Hickory varieties. A thoughtful choice for gift giving, the high-quality kitchen items provide sleek designs and convenient functionality for year after year of everyday convenience. Innovative Kitchen-Storage Solutions In the late-1970's, when the gourmet-chef-tools market in the U.S. was still in its infancy, J.K. Adams owner Malcolm Cooper, Sr. conceived of the first slanted knife block. His goal was to create a cutlery organizer that would hold knives at a low enough angle that they could be easily removed from the block when it was pushed back under a cabinet overhang. The J.K. Adams Kangaroo knife block was launched in 1980--the first-ever slanted knife block, and still the best. Recognizing the many opportunities to improve kitchen storage, J.K. Adams introduced the revolving \"carousel\" spice rack in 1982 followed by countless other well-designed storage products in the years since, including the popular in-drawer knife tray in 1994, a space-saving alternative to the knife block that offers the same safety and blade protection. In 2011, J.K. Adams takes cutlery storage to a new level once again with the new Universal knife block. For over 30 years, J.K. Adams has continued to lead and inspire the kitchen storage market with their innovative designs, superior hardwoods, and exemplary craftsmanship.  Today, J.K.

The rich heritage and folklore of the great Yankee Woodworker is as well known today as it was hundreds of years ago, and the craft has been handed down through the generations. J.K. Adams' success is certainly attributable to the early Vermonters employed by the company while in its infancy who brought forth the techniques and quality craftsmanship that could only come from generations of shared knowledge and experience. The J.K. Adams factory has been at the same location since the beginning. As many as three generations of families have relied on J.K. Adams to provide for their families.

Wood is naturally anti-bacterial, and any bacteria left on the board will actually lessen in time versus multiplying on a plastic cutting board. A wooden board will also be more gentle on your knife's edge, and it just feels and sounds better under a knife. Caring for Your J.K. Adams Cutting Board Wash by hand in warm soapy water and dry thoroughly, and oil frequently with mineral oil to help give it an optimal appearance. Do not soak, microwave, freeze, or put in the dishwasher. For removing stains, you can use a weak bleach-and-water solution or a combination of lemon juice and salt. Be sure to rinse and wipe with mineral oil afterward. Additionally, the surface can be sanded to make the board look like new--although a board with wear will add character to your kitchen. For storage, keep the board away from strong sunlight as avoiding UV rays will reduce the risk of fading.

The rich heritage and folklore of the great Yankee Woodworker is as well known today as it was hundreds of years ago, and the craft has been handed down through the generations. J.K. Adams' success is certainly attributable to the early Vermonters employed by the company while in its infancy who brought forth the techniques and quality craftsmanship that could only come from generations of shared knowledge and experience. The J.K. Adams factory has been at the same location since the beginning. As many as three generations of families have relied on J.K. Adams to provide for their families. Located in a rural area of Vermont, J.K. Adams remains one of the largest employers in the area and is an important pillar of support for the local community. J.K. Adams has always used the creativity and skill of their workforce in developing new products, and today J.K. Adams continues its New England craftsmanship with a wide variety of cutting boards, as well as wooden salad bowls, kitchen islands, and slate serving trays. And at the J.K. Adams factory, you'll find future generations of woodworkers building upon the traditions begun over 65 years ago. Cutting boards and other products by J.K Adams are made in the North America.     About J.K. Adams' Logo In colonial New England, three strokes of a broad ax were used to mark the finest trees in the forest for the Queens' Navy shipmasts. The broad arrow was adopted as our logo because it symbolizes the exceptional quality of wood that goes into our products. J.K. Adams' Company History  Started over 65 years ago in a small garage in Dorset, Vermont Cooper family purchased business from founder Josiah K. Adams in 1949 Began with the Speedy Racer toy, and then followed by manufacturing drafting and surveying tables, Kiwi shoe groomers, gifts, and furniture Now the leading supplier of wooden storage and food preparation products for the specialty housewares industry   Our Wood  Maple, Cherry, Walnut, Alder, Ash, and Hickory Either from New England or other North American sources Renewable and sustainable Hard and durable, yet forgiving to knife edges  Wood Grains End Grain  Prized for look and longest wear Identifiable by small pieces put together Board usually thick and heavy Many pieces, lots of glue joints, cracking can be a problem  Edge Grain  Most common in cutting boards Moderate grain pattern Stable with minimum glue joints  Why Choose a Wood Cutting Board? Wood is naturally anti-bacterial, and any bacteria left on the board will actually lessen in time versus multiplying on a plastic cutting board. A wooden board will also be more gentle on your knife's edge, and it just feels and sounds better under a knife. Caring for Your J.K. Adams Cutting Board Wash by hand in warm soapy water and dry thoroughly, and oil frequently with mineral oil to help give it an optimal appearance. Do not soak, microwave, freeze, or put in the dishwasher. For removing stains, you can use a weak bleach-and-water solution or a combination of lemon juice and salt. Be sure to rinse and wipe with mineral oil afterward. Additionally, the surface can be sanded to make the board look like new--although a board with wear will add character to your kitchen. For storage, keep the board away from strong sunlight as avoiding UV rays will reduce the risk of fading.   Environmental Responsibilities  We only purchase lumber from a select few suppliers who we are confident practice sustainable forestry practices Vermont forests are growing faster than they are being harvested J.K.

Use it for cleanly and effortlessly slicing through meat without any undue pressure required. Most often used for preparing sashimi, or sliced raw fish, the knife also works well for slicing honey baked ham, savory roasts, and other large cuts of meat. Like other knives in the Shun Pro line, the knife features a marvelous graffiti-etched blade made of pure high-carbon VG10 steel, which holds a razor-sharp edge longer than other premium steels. The blade's acid-etched design is slightly different with each style of knife, while consistently and cleverly incorporating the Shun logo neatly into the overall arrangement for a distinct and professional look. The knife also comes equipped with a D-shaped PakkaWood handle for a comfortable, secure grip. Though dishwasher-safe, Shun recommends washing the knife by hand for best results. The knife measures 12-1/5 by 8/9 by 1-4/5 inches and carries a limited lifetime warranty.  From the Manufacturer    Beautiful graffiti-etched blade with PakkaWood handle. View larger.  Pro Series Why Buy Shun Pro For the true Japanese food aficionado, nothing compares to the scalpel-like precision of a single bevel blade. The newly updated Shun Pro line features the same incredibly sharp chisel edges as in the past, combined with D-shaped PakkaWood handles, which lend a secure and comfortable grip. The beautiful graffiti-etched blade is made with high carbon VG10 steel, which takes and holds an edge longer than comparable knives. The blade backs are gently hollow ground, creating an air pocket between the knife and the food being cut, so the knife glides through food with quick precision. For those chefs who are truly into the Japanese method of cooking, the wide Shinogi (or blade bevel) makes sharpening these knives on a whetstone practically effortless. Knife styles in this line include the Deba (a multi-purpose prep knife), the Yanagiba (a long slicing knife perfect for sashimi), and the Nakiri (a vegetable chopping knife). These knives are essential for cooks who are seeking to prepare true Asian cuisine. NSF certified for use in commercial kitchens. Key Features  These knives feature a 1/2-inch wide Shinogi and single-bevel blade design preferred by Japanese chefs, to maintain cutting consistency, a critical element in Japanese cooking Traditional Japanese blade design for the ultimate knife connoisseur--single-beveled edge with a hollow ground (or concave ground) back; this means only the cutting edge of the blade touches the food for superior stick resistance and the cleanest cuts Constructed of 2.5 mm of pure, high-carbon VG-10 stainless-steel \"super steel\", composed of carbon, chromium, cobalt, manganese, molybdenum, silicon, and vanadium Single bevel edge, designed for precision cuts, slices efficiently and stays sharp over time These knives can easily be maintained by sharpening on a fine-grit whetstone or through professional sharpening Honyaki-style knife construction, consisting of one piece of steel Due to the single sided bevel design, Shun Pro knives are best suited for right-handed cooks D-shaped Pakkawood handles Sharpened using 1000 grit whetstone Hand wash and dry recommended; limited lifetime warranty  Highlights Honyaki Method of Knifemaking Whereas a knife made by the kasumi method has a cutting core jacketed with another steel, honyaki knives are made from a single piece of steel--usually very hard, high-carbon steel. Honyaki-method knives can be sharpened to an exquisitely sharp edge and retain that edge for a longer period of time. Because of the hardness of the steel and the precision of the processes needed to \"treat\" the steel properly, honyaki knives are more difficult to make and more labor-intensive than kasumi knives. As you might expect, this degree of difficulty makes honyaki knives the most prized and most expensive. The Shun Pro line, which features traditional single-beveled Japanese blade styles, is made by this method. PakkaWood PakkaWood is a premium handle material made of genuine hardwood impregnated with resin. The resin makes it moisture resistant, strong, and durable. Sanding and buffing brings PakkaWood to a beautiful gloss finish. As with natural wood, no two pieces of PakkaWood are exactly alike.    Specifications   Blade Material: VG-10 hardened Japanese steel, made with 2.5 mm blade stock, brushed for a matte finish.   Bevel: Single-beveled with hollow-ground back.   Cutting angle: 16 degrees (comprehensive angle 16 degrees).    Handle Material: Pakkawood (resin-impregnated hardwood); D-shaped handle, only available in right-handed version.   Sharpening recommendations: Regular sharpening (as needed) with a whetstone. Soak the whetstone for about 20 minutes, set on a damp cloth for stability, and pull the knife's edge across the whetstone at a 16 degree angle. The wide Shinogi (bevel) on the knife can be used as a guide, making it easy to maintain the knife's sharpness.     Professional Manufacturing    View larger.     View larger.     View larger.

To use, place the unit over a gas-stove burner or a portable camping stove; the gas flame enters through a circular opening in the base of the unit, then moves through a diffuser to evenly heat the food inside. One pair of double skewers, five standard skewers, and a chrome-plated grill basket come included. Simply load food into the basket or onto the skewers and hang vertically inside the grill for cooking with the option to rotate with a quick turn of the stay-cool handle. The grill can be used to cook up anything from steak, chicken, and fish to carrots, onions, peppers, and more. Best of all, it serves up to eight people at a time, cooking almost 4-1/2 pounds of meat in less than 20 minutes. When used outside, a piece of charcoal can be placed in the heat diffuser to create the smoky flavor of an authentic outdoor barbecue (do not use charcoal for indoor cooking). Other highlights include a catch basin at the bottom to catch all meat drippings, an aluminum upper body and lid with an electrostatic painted finish, stainless-steel heat diffuser and skewers, and Bakelite handles that stay cool to the touch for comfortable handling and safe transport. When finished, the unit disassembles for quick cleaning by hand or in the dishwasher. A fun addition to any party or gathering with family and friends, the portable barbecue grill measures approximately 14 by 18 by 16 inches. From the Manufacturer      The Brazilian barbecue phenomenon has exploded, but so far it's been limited to a restaurant experience. Grillex brings that same delicious taste into everyone's kitchen. Whether entertaining a group of friends or just spending some quality time with the family, the versatility of Grillex offers plenty of options for every household. It's simple, fast, and flavorful every time, making it the perfect product for any kitchen. Appetizers, dinner, and dessert--the possibilities with the Grillex are truly endless.  Grillex comes with five cooking skewers, a double skewer, and a basket that, after being prepared with meats, vegetables, and fruits, are suspended upright around virtually any heat source, such as stovetop burners, outdoor grills and camping stoves. A center diffuser provides even heat displacement to create the ideal environment for cooking various foods.    The Versatility of Grillex (It's Not Just for Brazilian BBQ)  While the origin of the Grillex is Brazilian, the versatility of the Grillex is unmatched. In addition to the traditional Brazilian fare, Grillex can also be used to cook a wide range of foods: appetizers, simple or gourmet meals, desserts, and more. Below is a partial listing of the recipes developed for the Grillex that go beyond the typical meats, vegetables and cheeses of a Brazilan BBQ:  Appetizers Bacon wrapped Scallops Prosciutto Wrapped Stuffed Mushrooms Soft Pretzel Twists Fast & Easy Grilled Herbed Broccoli Grilled Quesadillas Heavenly Chicken Nuggets Bratwurst Tequila Lime Beef Turkish Style Kabobs Grilled Teriyaki Skewers Ranch Roasted Potatoes Hot Dogs/ Polish Sausage--with a twist Gourmet Green Chile and Lime Carne Asada Honey Shrimp and Turkey Sausage Mango Pork Tenderloin Orange Pineapple Chicken Peasant Lamb with Herbs Goat Cheese Stuffed Pork Roasted Fingerling Potatoes Blackened Portabellas with Tzatziki Crab Stuffed Chile Rellanos Garlic and Thyme Potatoes International Corn Husk Kubideh Desserts Grilled Dessert Pineapple Bananas Foster sans alcohol Honeyed Greek Achladis Cherry Cream Pastry Chocolate Cream Pastry  Another benefit of the Grillex is that more than one type of food can be prepared and cooked all at the same time without taking a chance on the mixing of flavors--try that in a rotisserie! A perfect example of this is cooking two skewers of Soft Pretzel Twists while also grilling four skewers of Turkish Style Kabobs and rounding this out with two more skewers of bananas for Bananas Foster. Only in the Grillex can you cook all these at once without the mixing of the flavors. Not only does this make for great tasting meals, it's also efficient.  No Smoke and Easy to Clean      Other makers of indoor grills have tried to make one that doesn't smoke, but only Grillex is truly smoke free. The patented design of the Grillex keeps the juices from dripping on the heat source, eliminating the smoke. The best part about the Grillex is that you are actually cooking over a real flame, just as you would on an outside barbecue. The Grillex sits right on top of your existing gas range top.  Ask anyone what their least favorite part about cooking is and they'll tell you it\ufffds the clean up. With the Grillex, clean up is simple. When cooking with the Grillex, we recommend placing 1 cup of water in the base. This provides extra moisture to the food while cooking and makes for a simple clean-up. The water only comes in contact with the juices that drip from the food while cooking. Combined with the non-stick coating on the base of the grill, clean up is a breeze. Simply poor out the water and rinse and the skewers and baskets can be placed in a dishwasher.   Take Grillex Outdoors or On the Go    Grillex doesn't need to be kept in the kitchen; the Grillex can be taken anywhere. Another patented feature of the Grillex is the flavor bowl that is housed in the heat diffuser. When grilling outside, this feature allows for a piece of charcoal to be added just above the flame and below the food to give the extra-added flavor of cooking over a real wood or charcoal fire. Just as one would never bring a charcoal grill into the house, never place charcoal in the Grillex while cooking indoors as adequate ventilation does not exist in the home. The space saving design makes it simple to store the Grillex among pots and pans in a typical cupboard when not in use. When designing the Grillex, a great amount of thought was put into how the unit would be stored when not in use. The engineers wanted to give the most amount of space inside the Grillex to allow for cooking larger portions however, this also created the need for more space to store the grill. In the end, the engineers settled on a brilliant design for the upper body of the grill to turn upside down and nest inside the lower body for storage. The end result is the Grillex only needs a mere 5-1/2 inches of clearance on the shelf.      Great Materials, Built to Last      The majority of the Grillex is made of aluminum. Aluminum is lightweight so there is no need to worry about moving a heavy grill around the kitchen. The total weight of the grill alone is less than 4-1/2 pounds. Aluminum was also used because of its ability to evenly distribute the heat throughout the grill, which is also one of the Grillex patented technologies. The skewers are made of restaurant grade stainless steel. The handles on the skewers, basket, grill body, and lid are made of Bakelite, which provides years of use without degradation due to harsh conditions such as the heat from the grill or ongoing cleaning in a dishwasher. In addition, the handles were designed with ridges to help dissipate the heat when in use. In most cases, a hot pad is not necessary when using the handles.

Bamboo is stronger than most hard woods and it is the fastest growing plant on our planet. It does not require any special care to grow. In fact, it is a grass that produces more oxygen than a hard wood forest of comparable size, therefore reducing carbon dioxide gases associated with climate change. It also prevents soil erosion through its widespread root system and large canopy. At Totally Bamboo, we are proud to use \"Moso\" timber bamboo for its strength, density, versatility and high quality. It is harvested from our own bamboo forests which are not a habitat or food source for the great panda.

It is delicate enough to peel a tomato skin, but also sharp enough to cleanly peel a potato. The lightweight design and ergonomic, easy-grip handle makes it a pleasure to use. THE CERAMIC ADVANTAGE Imagine paper thin tomato slices or perfectly diced onions, Shenzhen Knives ceramic blades give you precision slicing every time due to ceramic\u2019s special material properties. The blade is made of an advanced ceramic called zirconium oxide that is much harder than steel, and second in hardness to only diamond. Ceramic blanks are produced by dry pressing zirconia powder and subjecting the blanks through an advanced heating process called, sintering. The ceramic blanks are then sharpened and honed to a razor sharp edge and attached to the knife handle. This results in an extremely hard blade that maintains its edge approximately 10-15 times longer than steel blades. That means your ceramic blades can be used longer without going dull. Ceramic is also non-reactive, which means ceramic blades will not rust and are easy to clean. Because of their resistance to strong oils and acids, they won\u2019t absorb flavors or odors from foods; which won\u2019t leave any after-taste residue on foods that you slice. It also keeps fruit and vegetables from browning as quickly. THE SHENZHEN KNIVES ADVANTAGE Shenzhen Knives is the leading online brand of ceramic knives and ceramic blade utensils. As a result of our e-commerce only sales model, we can make high performance ceramic technology available to everyone. Even though ceramic blade technology was first introduced over 25 years ago, the price has not changed much, even with improvements in ceramic technology and manufacturing. We soon realized that there were so many layers of marketing and distribution. At Shenzhen Knives we do not spend millions on celebrity chef\u2019s endorsements, and avoid brick and mortar retailers who need to add their huge markup to cover their overhead. We felt that such a great product \u2013that doesn\u2019t need to be sharpened as often as a steel blade, and knowing the blade won\u2019t rust \u2013 should be in everyone's kitchen. BUY ONE, GIVE ONE While we are in business to make a profit, we also decided to position Shenzhen Knives as a company that would not only sell consumer products to make a profit, but to also do good. When you buy a knife or knife set, we will donate a meal to needy children. And while our manufacturing costs are still higher than the bigger brands, by relying mainly on our e-commerce model, bypassing distributors and eschewing flashy marketing campaigns, this helps keep our operating costs and prices low. More importantly, this allows us to re-direct some of that savings that would have gone to middlemen or celebrity chefs, to both the consumer and people in need. OUR PROMISE TO TREAT CUSTOMERS FAIRLY At Shenzhen Knives, we do not have a 100-page customer service policy handbook. Instead, we live by the simple motto of \u201ctreat customers how you would like to be treated\u201d. And that is the mandate that guides our interaction with customers. And while most companies don\u2019t want to point out their mistakes, we invite you to look at some of our negative reviews and see how our customer support measures up to other companies. It\u2019s our belief that customer support doesn\u2019t mean much when you like the product or the product works perfectly. It\u2019s only important when something goes wrong, and the measure of a good company is how they react to dissatisfied customers or mistakes. And while we strive to have 0% defective rates on our products and 100% satisfaction, we realize that mistakes do happen from time to time, and when that happens, please let us know. SPREAD THE WORD!

Some accounts trace the Guild's birth to Athens in the latter half of the 4th century BCE. Allegedly, several lesser philosophers grew weary of the endless Socratic dialogue endemic in their trade and turned to crafting household implements and playthings. (Hence the assertions that Socrates quaffed his hemlock poison from a Guild-designed chalice, though vigorous debate surrounds the question of whether it was a \"disappearing\" chalice.) Others argue that the UPG dates from the High Middle Ages, when the Philosophers Guild entered the world of commerce by selling bawdy pamphlets to pilgrims facing long lines for the restroom. Business boomed until 1211 when Pope Innocent III condemned the publications. Not surprisingly, this led to increased sales, even as half our membership was burned at the stake. More recently, revisionist historians have pinpointed the birth of the Guild to the time it was still cool to live in New York City's Lower East Side. Two brothers turned their inner creativity and love of paying rent towards fulfilling the people's needs for finger puppets, warm slippers, coffee cups, and cracking up at stuff.

Safety and practicality were the guiding principles during the development process, and our little Kettle came complete with an innovative steam shield.  Through user feedback, we realized we missed a key consumer insight \u2013 that a Tea Kettle, while a practical kitchen tool, is often a centerpiece in the kitchen. Users would leave them out on the stovetop when not in use and some even coordinated their entire kitchen decor around their Kettles. While the steam shield was innovative, it was considered by many to be unsightly (some likened it to the \"Flying Nun\"!).  In 1999, we corrected the aesthetic flaws to our otherwise safe, practical and well-performing Kettle with the Uplift. The kicker is that all of its elegant aesthetics came as a direct result of making the Uplift safe and easy to use.  OXO Good Grips Uplift Tea KettleFun Fact:  The OXO Uplift Tea Kettle has an iconic shape that has become an instant American classic. It is the most requested OXO item used in propping television and movie sets. Look for it next time you watch \"The Big Bang Theory!\" Problems Identified Handles on tea kettles are positioned too close to the steam and hot water at the spout, making it uncomfortable while pouringAngle of kettle handles combined with weight of filled kettle make it difficult for users to lift and pour without straining wristsFine motor skills required to open kettle trigger to pour hot water; difficult for many older users to maneuverSmall opening on top makes it difficult to clean interior of kettle The Process The quest for the perfect interaction point between the spout and the handle (so the kettle would not open when carried around filled with water, but would open easily when tipped forward) led us to the current connection between the spout and handle, one that resembles a splash of water.The same connection point was also designed to keep the spout open if the user chose, so that they could keep the Uplift's whistle quiet while boiling water, which is especially handy when preparing an early morning cup of tea.While designing an opening large enough to be easy to clean, we needed to ensure it wasn't so low as to limit the maximum water level, but we still needed to keep it in balance with the spout for aesthetic reasons.Through user research, we learned that steam would sometimes escape from the lid and unfortunately heat the handle, so we added a silicone seal to minimize any unintended heat transfer and keep the kettle safe and easy to use. OXO Good Grips Classic Tea KettleOXO's Solutions Large, comfortable handle is angled away from the spout and is heat resistant and non-slip, even when wetHandle angle allows user to hold Kettle comfortably and without wrist strain, whether filled with water or nearly empty, by adjusting grip accordinglyWhistle spout opens automatically when Kettle is tipped to pour \u2013 no awkward buttons or levers to pressWide opening on top of Kettle enables easy access for cleaning and can also be used as an opening to fill Kettle The OXO Story: In 1990, OXO staged a revolution (of sorts) by offering an easy-to-use, high-performing alternative to uncomfortable and ineffective kitchen gadgets. OXO's innovative take on the traditional Swivel Peeler, complete with its pudgy black handle, raised consumers' expectations of what could be expected from household products.  Today OXO offers over 800 products, each developed with a close (some might say \"obsessive\") attention to detail. Our goal is to deliver products that maximize comfort AND performance, illustrating our mission to create innovative consumer products that make everyday living easier.

Maximum Nutrition Beneficial nutrients found in food are retained in the pouches, instead of being lost in steam, discarded in cooking liquid or left in the pan, as happens in traditional cooking methods.   Product FAQs  What equipment do you need to cook sous vide? In order to maintain the precise control of temperature, sous vide cooking requires a tightly temperature-controlled water bath and a means to vacuum seal the foods to be cooked. One of the easiest ways to cook sous vide is using a self-contained water oven, such as the SousVide Supreme, which allows you to set the temperature and let it do the cooking for you with no monitoring required.  The key is accuracy and the SousVide Supreme offers technology that maintains constant temperatures within +-0.5 degree C or 1 degree F. To seal foods for sous vide cooking requires nothing more than a common kitchen vacuum sealer and food grade plastic vacuum seal pouches, approved for cooking. Can I buy replacement bags for the SousVide Supreme Vacuum Sealer? Absolutely. Cooking pouches are available in, 1-quart/.95-liter or 1-gallon/3.79-liter sizes, as well as pouch rolls that  can be cut and sealed to your desired size. We also offer zip pouches, which can be used without a vacuum sealer, particularly useful for liquids or liquid-rich foods. All of our pouches have been third party tested and verified to be free of Bisphenol-A, lead, polyethylene and any phthalates, and to withstand and remain stable at high cooking temperatures for extended periods of time. Will any other bags work with the SousVide Supreme Vacuum Sealer? For the best quality sous vide cooking bag, we recommend using only the SousVide Supreme Vacuum Sealer bags. However, our system will also work with some other bags, such as those by Food Saver. Any bag used for sous vide cooking, however, should always be made of food grade plastic and approved for cooking. What kind of foods can you cook sous vide?  All kinds! Any type of meat\u2014such as beef, pork, lamb, game, or poultry\u2014is ideal for sous vide. It works especially well with fish and seafood, ensuring that these delicate foods are not overcooked. Almost any vegetable can also be cooked sous vide with delicious results, as can eggs and many fruits. You can even use it to make custard-style ice cream base, b\u00e9arnaise sauce, cr\u00e8me Anglaise, custards, cheese, yogurt, and even cakes. Just about anything that requires a precise temperature to cook can be a candidate for sous vide cooking. How do you season food to be cooked?  The sous vide process locks in a food\u2019s natural flavors and infuses the seasoning into the food which means seasoning can be lighter than with other methods. When applying seasonings, start with a light hand and work your way up. For example, you can experiment with fresh or dried herbs, seasoning blends, sliced lemons/ limes, and chilis.  How much food can you fit in the SousVide Supreme?  Generally speaking, the SousVide Supreme Demi holds approximately twelve 4 ounce portions of food. The amount of food that will fit comfortably into the water oven depends on the food in question. The general requirement is that the food pouch (es) should not completely cover the perforated grill on the bottom of the unit. Convection circulation of water through the grill holes and between pouches is important to maintaining constant temperature throughout the bath.  The pouch rack solves this problem by keeping the pouches up off the perforated grill and apart from each other as well as allowing you to cook a surprisingly large quantity of food. Insert the rack horizontally to hold up to four large (gallon) cooking pouches. The rack can also be removed to accommodate large food items, such as a 6-pound leg of lamb, beef or pork roast, or beef or pork tenderloin. The key here is to make certain that the water can flow freely around the pouches to ensure even cooking. Can you cook an entire meal in a SousVide Supreme?  There are some one-pot meals and pasta meals that work in the SousVide Supreme we\u2019re working to develop more. In general, vegetables require a higher temperature to soften and become tender than fish, poultry, or meat. Thus fish, meat, or poultry cooked at the same time as vegetables will be somewhat overcooked, as would be the case in a slow cooker. To cook them together, however, you can quickly saut\u00e9 the vegetables in the skillet and then add them to the meat and cook at the lower temperature required by the meat, fish, or poultry in the SousVide Supreme.   Comparing the SousVide Supreme with the SousVide Supreme Demi  Both the original SousVide Supreme water oven and the new SousVide Supreme Demi are extremely easy to use and feature sleek contemporary countertop design. Either SousVide Supreme unit will allow you to cook all your food to perfection with tenderness and flavor unlike you have ever experienced. The main differences are cooking capacity, footprint size and exterior finish.  The following comparison chart will help you to select which model is best for you.

Then the blades are bead-blasted to reveal the elegant, waved pattern. In addition to its beauty, the Damascus has two purposes. First, it protects and supports the extremely hard cutting core.

Knees aching from kneeling on tile to bathe your toddler? Thinking of throwing in the towel because of pain from standing to fold clothes? Sublime comes to the rescue with their anti-fatigue comfort mats. Sublime's Imprint anti-fatigue comfort mats offer a solution to a problem for homeowners who stand in front of their kitchen sinks, stoves, and washers/dryers. Imprint anti-fatigue comfort mats bring cushion to everywhere you stand and actually help relieve foot and back discomfort. In addition, Imprint anti-fatigue comfort mats are made out of a new technology that is non-toxic, and is manufactured without the use of toxic, heavy metals. Perfect for many areas of the home including the kitchen, laundry, bathroom, and garage. From Sublime Marketing Group, LLC Imprint anti-fatigue comfort mats offer a solution to a problem for people who stand in front of their kitchen sinks, stoves, and washers and dryers. Imprint anti-fatigue comfort mats work by conforming to the shape of your feet and supporting the arches. The result is increased blood flow and soothing relief from pressure that is often felt from standing on hard surfaces.     Excellent for the kitchen and other areas of the house.          Imprint anti-fatigue comfort mats provide instant relief for all areas of the home, including the bathroom.     Imprint anti-fatigue comfort mats aren't only good for your health, they are good for our planet as they are made out of a new, patented eco9 technology that is non-toxic, safe and is manufactured without the use of toxic metals.  Our offerings are free of phthalates and harmful heavy metal substances (Pb,ba,Cd,Hg,Cr,As,Sb,Se) and pass both US and European testing standards including the very strict children's toy standards for our children's play mats. The environmental benefits are both in the production stage by eliminating the typical toxic emissions during production as well as disposal stage by eliminating concerns of having toxic heavy metal stabilizers leaching into ground water and the elimination of pollution off gasses if the products are incinerated.  Typical competitive products are made of PVC which release toxic emissions such as hydrogen chloride, chlorobenzene, chloromethane, and dioxins into the atmosphere gases from the breakdown of PVC. Phthalates are esters of phthalic acid and are mainly used as plasticizers and are added to plastics to increase their flexibility, transparency, durability and longevity. They are primarily used to soften polyvinyl chloride (PVC). Eventually PVC products need to be disposed of and when incinerated they may release emissions such as hydrogen chloride, chlorobenzene, chloromethane, and dioxins into the atmosphere. DEHP, a phthalate plasticizer used to soften PVC, may leach from PVC and may have links to reproductive birth defects and other harmful effects, according to animal studies. Landfills are not a good option for PVC products either as they can contain additives, such as biocides, lubricants, and toxic heavy metal stabilizers which can potentially leach into ground water. Landfill fires can also result in the air pollution issue cited above. Imprint anti-fatigue comfort mats with eco9 technology are the right choice for the environment.        Suits all types of flooring.        Looks great in all types of kitchens.     Reduces Fatigue by over 50%We recently completed a study with a major University School of Ergonomics and our mats were \"shown to significantly reduce pain and lessen discomfort\" when compared to standing on a hard surface.

These stoneware pieces features Le Creuset's legendary raised rings and a perfectly matched pallete of signature shades.  Each piece of Le Creuset dinnerware is crafted in the same careful process as all Le Creuset stoneware - with a colorful, durable exterior enamel that matches other stoneware flawlessly while protecting from utensil marks and scratches. Every plate, bowl and mug is designed to complement any collection of stoneware, and is finished with Le Creuset's signature three-ring accent along the exterior.  Features High-quality exterior enamel protects against metal marks and other damageHard-wearing, impermeable finish fired at temperatures as high as 2192 degrees F is safe for cutting on with knivesUnmatched thermal resistance from -65 degrees F to 500 degrees F -- safe for the freezer, microwave, oven, broiler and dishwasherLess than 1% porosity, blocking moisture absorption which can lead to cracking, crazing and rippling along the interiorUnique clay mixture that creates a very dense material when fired, maintaining even temperatures and preventing scorchingResistant to staining and flavor/odor absorptionA perfectly color-matched palette of bold, consistent tones for easy mixing and matching with other Le Creuset products    Introduction All items in the Le Creuset stoneware range are original designs and have been hand-crafted, making each piece unique. Due to this uniqueness, there may be slight variations from piece to piece. Le Creuset Stoneware is safe for use in the microwave, freezer, refrigerator, dishwasher, oven and broiler. The maximum oven-safe temperature is 500 degrees F / 260 degrees C. The enameled surface is easy to clean and scratch-resistant. The enamel is completely hygienic and will not absorb odors or flavors. Le Creuset Stoneware is extremely strong and durable, and resists staining, chipping and cracking. The handles, knobs and rims have been designed for a secure, easy-to-hold grip. Cleaning and Care DO NOT use any Stoneware piece on the stovetop or any other direct heat source. OVEN: Maximum oven-safe temperature is 500 degrees F / 260 degrees C. Use oven mitts for lifting at all times. BROILER: When using under a broiler allow a gap of no less than 2 1/2 inches between the rim of the dish and the heat source. MICROWAVE: Handles may become hot during prolonged microwave use, especially if the handles are enclosed with plastic wrap. Cover just the open top of the dish, leaving the handles exposed. FREEZER-TO-OVEN USE: Do not place a frozen dish of food in a preheated oven. Place the frozen dish in a cold oven and set the temperature, allowing the dish and oven to heat together. Before serving always check that the center of the food is completely and uniformly hot. CLEANING: Before the first use, wash the dish in hot, soapy water, and rinse and dry thoroughly. For most day-to-day cleaning, cool the dish for a few minutes before washing and drying, or wash in the dishwasher, allowing the full cycle to complete. Never leave a dish fully immersed in water. For removal of stubborn residues allow the dish to cool, fill with warm, soapy water and allow it to soak for 10 to 20 minutes. Wash in the usual way using a plastic brush or scouring pad if necessary. ", "salesrank_2018": "28397"}, "B003F3QRFQ": {"description": "blomus towel stand with polystone base.
