Foods cooked sous vide develop flavors and textures that simply cannot be duplicated using any other traditional cooking method.  Cooking sous vide offers many benefits:    Incredible Taste Natural flavor and juices are infused into the food while in the cooking pouch resulting in incomparable taste and texture.     Convenience and Foolproof Results Anyone can now cook food to perfection, and the minimal hands-on cooking saves time. Like your own personal chef, the SousVide Supreme cooks during the workday or overnight, freeing you to do other things.      Maximum Nutrition Beneficial nutrients found in food are retained in the pouches, instead of being lost in steam, discarded in cooking liquid or left in the pan, as happens in traditional cooking methods.   Product FAQs  What equipment do you need to cook sous vide? In order to maintain the precise control of temperature, sous vide cooking requires a tightly temperature-controlled water bath and a means to vacuum seal the foods to be cooked. One of the easiest ways to cook sous vide is using a self-contained water oven, such as the SousVide Supreme, which allows you to set the temperature and let it do the cooking for you with no monitoring required.  The key is accuracy and the SousVide Supreme offers technology that maintains constant temperatures within +-0.5 degree C or 1 degree F. To seal foods for sous vide cooking requires nothing more than a common kitchen vacuum sealer and food grade plastic vacuum seal pouches, approved for cooking. Can I buy replacement bags for the SousVide Supreme Vacuum Sealer? Absolutely. Cooking pouches are available in, 1-quart/.95-liter or 1-gallon/3.79-liter sizes, as well as pouch rolls that  can be cut and sealed to your desired size. We also offer zip pouches, which can be used without a vacuum sealer, particularly useful for liquids or liquid-rich foods. All of our pouches have been third party tested and verified to be free of Bisphenol-A, lead, polyethylene and any phthalates, and to withstand and remain stable at high cooking temperatures for extended periods of time. Will any other bags work with the SousVide Supreme Vacuum Sealer? For the best quality sous vide cooking bag, we recommend using only the SousVide Supreme Vacuum Sealer bags. However, our system will also work with some other bags, such as those by Food Saver. Any bag used for sous vide cooking, however, should always be made of food grade plastic and approved for cooking. What kind of foods can you cook sous vide?  All kinds! Any type of meat\u2014such as beef, pork, lamb, game, or poultry\u2014is ideal for sous vide. It works especially well with fish and seafood, ensuring that these delicate foods are not overcooked. Almost any vegetable can also be cooked sous vide with delicious results, as can eggs and many fruits. You can even use it to make custard-style ice cream base, b\u00e9arnaise sauce, cr\u00e8me Anglaise, custards, cheese, yogurt, and even cakes. Just about anything that requires a precise temperature to cook can be a candidate for sous vide cooking. How do you season food to be cooked?  The sous vide process locks in a food\u2019s natural flavors and infuses the seasoning into the food which means seasoning can be lighter than with other methods. When applying seasonings, start with a light hand and work your way up. For example, you can experiment with fresh or dried herbs, seasoning blends, sliced lemons/ limes, and chilis.  How much food can you fit in the SousVide Supreme?  Generally speaking, the SousVide Supreme Demi holds approximately twelve 4 ounce portions of food. The amount of food that will fit comfortably into the water oven depends on the food in question. The general requirement is that the food pouch (es) should not completely cover the perforated grill on the bottom of the unit. Convection circulation of water through the grill holes and between pouches is important to maintaining constant temperature throughout the bath.  The pouch rack solves this problem by keeping the pouches up off the perforated grill and apart from each other as well as allowing you to cook a surprisingly large quantity of food. Insert the rack horizontally to hold up to four large (gallon) cooking pouches. The rack can also be removed to accommodate large food items, such as a 6-pound leg of lamb, beef or pork roast, or beef or pork tenderloin. The key here is to make certain that the water can flow freely around the pouches to ensure even cooking. Can you cook an entire meal in a SousVide Supreme?  There are some one-pot meals and pasta meals that work in the SousVide Supreme we\u2019re working to develop more. In general, vegetables require a higher temperature to soften and become tender than fish, poultry, or meat. Thus fish, meat, or poultry cooked at the same time as vegetables will be somewhat overcooked, as would be the case in a slow cooker. To cook them together, however, you can quickly saut\u00e9 the vegetables in the skillet and then add them to the meat and cook at the lower temperature required by the meat, fish, or poultry in the SousVide Supreme.   Comparing the SousVide Supreme with the SousVide Supreme Demi \u00a0  Both the original SousVide Supreme water oven and the new SousVide Supreme Demi are extremely easy to use and feature sleek contemporary countertop design. Either SousVide Supreme unit will allow you to cook all your food to perfection with tenderness and flavor unlike you have ever experienced. The main differences are cooking capacity, footprint size and exterior finish.  The following comparison chart will help you to select which model is best for you.

Conventional cookware brands achieve their non-stick performance through a coating of PTFE (PolyTetraFluoroEthylene), a synthetic substance that has waxy properties. At very high temperatures, PTFE decomposes and releases fumes which are documented as lethal to small pets, and harmful to humans. In addition, traditional pans using PTFE are often manufactured with the aid of PFOA (PerFluoroOctanoic Acid), which the EPA has classified as a \u2018persistent pollutant of the environment\u2019 and APEOs (Alkylphenol ethoxylates), which are under restricted use in Germany due to environmental concerns. With the Green Earth Pan\u2019s GREBLON ceramic from Germany, even under high temperatures, no such fumes are ever released. This is because the Green Earth Pan utilizes an inert, 100% ceramic coating, inspired by nature, and applied using a water based Sol Gel Technique that is free of the harmful chemicals NMP (N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone) and NEP (N-ethyl-2-pyrrolidone). The Green Earth Pan\u2019s ceramic coating is ultra-safe and far more durable and scratch-resistant than other non-stick surfaces. With better non-stick properties, the Green Earth Pan allows you to saut\u00e9, fry, bake, boil and braise with as little as half the amount of oil normally used, and cleaning is a breeze. The exterior is made of the highest quality die-cast aluminum that allows for even cooking without hot spots. It boasts a magnetized bottom for rapid heat transfer on induction stoves, and a heat resistant silicone coated handle.

The Capresso Coffee Burr Grinder with 17 grind settings allows for adjustment from coarse to fine for any brewing method. Grinding fresh whole bean coffee immediately before brewing is the first step to achieving the best tasting coffee at home. Ground coffee interacts with the air around it and, within hours, loses a great deal of flavor and aroma. The longer the ground coffee is exposed to air the more flavor is lost and the rich, full-bodied taste of the coffee cannot be obtained. Just the Right Grind How Things Work Setting the Timer The timer can be set to grind for 2 to 12 cups of brewed coffee. When grinding in the finest position, less coffee per second will pass through the grinder than when grinding in the coarsest setting. The amount of ground coffee varies quite a bit depending on how coarse or fine you grind and whether you use light, dry beans or dark, oily beans. After grinding a few times, you will find the correct grind amount position for the amount of coffee you want to grind.

EarthChef has found the perfect replacement for wood. Thanks to its rapid growth, bamboo is the top candidate as natural renewable resource. Choose from a variety of bamboo cutting boards, kitchen utensils, blocks, and more. End Grain: Made from the end of the bamboo, the hardest section. The highest quality bamboo cutting board available. It is perfect for heavy chopping and cutting. Vertical Grain: Made from the side grain of the bamboo, which is slightly softer than the end grain. Its primary use is for cutting and light chopping.       Choose from a variety of bamboo cutting boards, kitchen utensils, blocks, and more.  Induction   Induction cooktops for faster, more efficient cooking.  Induction is the third method of cookware; it is more efficient than electricity and faster than gas. It works off of reverse magnetism and has been used by chefs, hotel chains, and caterers globally for many years. It is also widely popular in households in Europe and Asia. To test if your pots and pans are induction ready, do a simple magnet test. If a magnet sticks to the bottom of your pot or pan, it is induction ready. Why induction cooking? You save energy three ways:  Induction heats up your pots/pans super fast, resulting in less cooking time It uses less electricity than an electrical element, and is more efficient (less wasted heat and energy) The pan itself is the element or source of heat, resulting in less temperature  EarthChef Cookware - Care and Maintenance Before your first-time use: After unpacking your cookware, make sure to remove all labels and then wash in warm, soapy water with a soft sponge. Rinse thoroughly and dry completely with a soft cloth. EarthChef cookware is dishwasher-safe, on the economy cycle, but we recommend washing them by hand. This extra care uses less water and energy and protects your pans from the harsh heat and detergent of a dishwasher. Before heating your new EarthChef Nonstick cookware for the first time, you should lightly coat the inside of the pan's nonstick surface with a little vegetable oil on a paper towel or soft cloth. This will lightly season the pan's surface and enhance the nonstick properties of the all-natural ceramic coating. Cooking with your new EarthChef products Using oils, butter, or margarine to fry or saute foods in your new EarthChef Nonstick cookware is not necessary due to the all-natural nonstick ceramic coating. If you choose to cook with one of these products to enhance browning or flavor, you should follow these guidelines:  Be sure that you always start with a clean pan. All oils smoke or burn at different temperatures. Be sure to test the oil that you are cooking with at a low to medium heat prior to adding your food to the pan. Add just enough oil to cover the bottom surface. Allow the oil to heat for one to two minutes over low to medium heat before adding food to the pan. The preheated oil will also help enhance the nonstick properties of the pan. Allow your food to come up to room temperature for about 10 minutes before adding it to the pan.  Other helpful tips while using your EarthChef cookware  Always try to match the size of the burner to the base of the cookware piece you are using. If you are using a gas cooktop, be sure to adjust the flame so that it does not flare up the sides of the pan. This will cause discoloration on the outside of the pan, possible damage to the handle, and possible personal injury from getting burned, as well as using more energy. You should use medium heat when preparing meals. You should only use high heat when the pot is full of liquid for boiling pasta, making stocks or deep-frying. While you can use metal utensils with your EarthChef nonstick cookware, they will cause some scratching of the surface and scratches are not covered in the warranty. We recommend using bamboo, silicone, nylon, or wood utensils to protect and extend the life of your pan. Never cut food while in the pan or gouge the pan as this will damage the surface and will not be covered in the warranty. Never allow a pan to boil dry. If you have remains of food stuck to the cookware, for example from blackening fish, they can easily be removed by covering the bottom of the pan with water and letting it soak off at a very low temperature. Burnt-on remains can be removed in a similar way, by letting the water boil in the pot or pan for just a few minutes and then working the burnt area with a wood spoon. Do NOT use a metal utensil as you can gouge the coating's finish. For your stainless-steel cookware, you can also use special detergents such as BergHOFF's Stainless Cleanser or BergHOFF's Magic for Stainless Steel. Care and Cleaning All BergHOFF products are designed to exceed your expectations; however their performance can be diminished if they are not properly cared for. Remember to cool your pans down before cleaning them as you can warp your pan by putting it into water directly from the heat source. Be sure to clean your pan thoroughly after each use, using warm, soapy water and sponge or a dishcloth. Then rinse in warm water and dry immediately to prevent water spotting with a soft cloth. Do NOT use steel wool or nylon scrubbing pads, oven cleaner or any cleaner that is abrasive, is a citrus based cleanser or contains chlorine bleach, especially on your stainless-steel pans as this will damage your pans finish. Do NOT gouge the nonstick coating. While your EarthChef pans are dishwasher-safe, be sure that you do NOT use a detergent on your stainless-steel pans that is based on citric acids (lemons) or contains chlorine bleach. These products can damage the anti-oxidation layer and can lead to corrosive reactions. Any signs of corrosion can easily be removed by using a good stainless-steel cleanser, like BergHOFF's Stainless Cleanser or Magic for Stainless Steel. Also, you should use the lowest heat setting as high drying temperatures can also cause damage to the anti-oxidation layer.

The non stick-coating on the aluminum pans is naturally six times stronger than any traditional nonstick coating and does not contain toxic or hazardous materials. (PFOA-free and PTFE-free).

Since 1996, we have been effectively addressing the strenuous demands of many commercial industries. Our Smart Step mats are the mat-of-choice for Homeland Security and TSA. They are widely advocated by healthcare professionals, and are the industry favorite for hotels, casinos, airports, professional kitchens, and hundreds of retailers across the country. We successfully addressed the health and safety concerns of corporate America, and with confidence we extend that care into the homes of millions with the Smart Step Collection. SmartTechTM Polyurethane (STP) one-piece technology is our innovative, proprietary manufacturing technique. The unique one piece construction of the Smart Step mat eliminates the need for glues or toxic bonding agents that often break down in time. Our mats will never separate, bubble up, ripple, or tear as a result of broken down glues. Our 5/8-inch polyurethane composite effectively suspends body weight, reducing impact on the back, legs, and feet, while encouraging proprioception (rebalancing). The result is: consistent comfort, better circulation and less fatigue. The gradually beveled edges of all Smart Step mats will never curl up- which prevents dangerous trip hazards. Our SmartTechTM Polyurethane technology includes 100-percent memory properties, meaning the mat is cured flat and will always remain flat. They will never delaminate or separate, compress or wear through, and they are easy to clean. Smart Step mats are virtually indestructible. Evolved from commercial settings, they require no special care. Most spills can easily be cleaned with a towel. For more difficult spills and stains, Smart Step mats can be simply cleaned with any household.

These stoneware pieces features Le Creuset's legendary raised rings and a perfectly matched pallete of signature shades.  Each piece of Le Creuset dinnerware is crafted in the same careful process as all Le Creuset stoneware - with a colorful, durable exterior enamel that matches other stoneware flawlessly while protecting from utensil marks and scratches. Every plate, bowl and mug is designed to complement any collection of stoneware, and is finished with Le Creuset's signature three-ring accent along the exterior.  Features High-quality exterior enamel protects against metal marks and other damageHard-wearing, impermeable finish fired at temperatures as high as 2192 degrees F is safe for cutting on with knivesUnmatched thermal resistance from -65 degrees F to 500 degrees F -- safe for the freezer, microwave, oven, broiler and dishwasherLess than 1% porosity, blocking moisture absorption which can lead to cracking, crazing and rippling along the interiorUnique clay mixture that creates a very dense material when fired, maintaining even temperatures and preventing scorchingResistant to staining and flavor/odor absorptionA perfectly color-matched palette of bold, consistent tones for easy mixing and matching with other Le Creuset products    Introduction All items in the Le Creuset stoneware range are original designs and have been hand-crafted, making each piece unique. Due to this uniqueness, there may be slight variations from piece to piece. Le Creuset Stoneware is safe for use in the microwave, freezer, refrigerator, dishwasher, oven and broiler. The maximum oven-safe temperature is 500 degrees F / 260 degrees C. The enameled surface is easy to clean and scratch-resistant. The enamel is completely hygienic and will not absorb odors or flavors. Le Creuset Stoneware is extremely strong and durable, and resists staining, chipping and cracking. The handles, knobs and rims have been designed for a secure, easy-to-hold grip. Cleaning and Care DO NOT use any Stoneware piece on the stovetop or any other direct heat source. OVEN: Maximum oven-safe temperature is 500 degrees F / 260 degrees C. Use oven mitts for lifting at all times. BROILER: When using under a broiler allow a gap of no less than 2 1/2 inches between the rim of the dish and the heat source. MICROWAVE: Handles may become hot during prolonged microwave use, especially if the handles are enclosed with plastic wrap. Cover just the open top of the dish, leaving the handles exposed. FREEZER-TO-OVEN USE: Do not place a frozen dish of food in a preheated oven. Place the frozen dish in a cold oven and set the temperature, allowing the dish and oven to heat together. Before serving always check that the center of the food is completely and uniformly hot. CLEANING: Before the first use, wash the dish in hot, soapy water, and rinse and dry thoroughly. For most day-to-day cleaning, cool the dish for a few minutes before washing and drying, or wash in the dishwasher, allowing the full cycle to complete. Never leave a dish fully immersed in water. For removal of stubborn residues allow the dish to cool, fill with warm, soapy water and allow it to soak for 10 to 20 minutes. Wash in the usual way using a plastic brush or scouring pad if necessary.

It carries a 6-month warranty, parts and labor. As with all Dyson vacuum cleaners, DC23 Turbinehead has no loss of suction. Dyson refurbished vacuums have been stripped down, cleaned out, reassembled and thoroughly tested. They\u2019re restored to a fully functional condition. In short, they are everything a Dyson machine should be- they work properly and don\u2019t lose suction. Dyson refurbishes vacuums that are returned to us by retailers or consumers.  Refurbishing these machines, rather than disposing of them, means that the parts and materials are re-used instead of wasted. When a machine comes to us to be refurbished, it is first stripped down as far as necessary. Components removed from the machine that meet our high standards of quality are kept and cleaned. Most damaged or broken components are sent away for recycling. The core of the machine is thoroughly cleaned and new parts are added to replace damaged or cosmetically unacceptable parts discovered during the stripping down process. Just like our brand new machines, the rebuilt machine then undergoes a comprehensive series of electrical and performance tests to ensure that it works as it should. For our vacuums, one of the tests carried out is a suction test. All refurbished vacuums are electrically tested in compliance with electrical and safety requirements. One of the primary differences between a new Dyson machine and a refurbished Dyson machine is its appearance\u2013 a scratch here or there or a slightly clouded bin may provide a clue that it has been previously used. After it has passed all of the tests, the machine is then packaged and sent out.  All Dyson refurbished vacuums come with a 6 month parts and labor warranty.

We can't stand the status quo\u2014especially when the status quo stinks. That was literally true back in 1982, when you had two options for getting garlic into your meal: chop up a fresh clove and have your hands smell for the rest of the day, or settle for a couple of thin, dry flakes tapped out of a plastic container. For our founder, CEO, and Famous Inventor David Holcomb, there really was no option. He had to do better, and he knew he could. Fast forward a few decades and David's first creation, the Garlic Machine, has become Chef'n. We're a growing Seattle-based company with more than 250 product patents worldwide and a single mission. We want to make better tools so you can make better food. It's what drives our in-house design team to reinvent the utensils and gadgets that most of us take for granted while we're cooking and cleaning. It's what attracts the terrific, talented people we've welcomed into our Chef'n family. And it's what compels us to tell everyone we meet about the innovation Chef'n products can bring to their kitchens. Is anyone listening? Well, the design awards and magazine covers seem to say yes, but for us the true test is in the homes of real people around the world. So put one of our inventions to work, create something delicious, and we look forward to hearing from you about your Chef'n experience.

That is why our company motto is:\"Not only does Oregon have great wines; but we also do a great job making fine RACKS too.\" This 120 bottle rack has 8 shelves (15 bottles per shelf) and each shelf holds 2 rows. The first row (bottom row) holds 8 bottles and the 2nd row will hold 7 bottles. Structurally the upright/s isn't one solid piece. Each upright is held together with dowels. The 3rd picture demonstrates this. This rack is a Rustic grade. In our manufacturing process, we refer to this Rustic grade as our \" A minus\" grade. It's only slightly lower than our perfect \"A\" grade. And the average person doesn't notice any difference. See below for explanation of our \"A minus\" grade. As a kid growing up in Oregon, I've learned that a man's word is a reflection of his values and integrity. So when I say that, \"You'll be happy with my product\"; or I will take it back at no cost to you! I REALLY mean it (if you don't believe me; read my reviews). So if you want to buy a Great rack (made in the USA); there is NO reason to go any farther! In our \"A minus\" grade, we let an occasional piece include one of the following: machining defects, slough (sluff) knot, star checked knot, black encased knot, blue stain (light) and some heart stain (reddish in color). If you would like to see pictures of these allowable visual defects; please send an email to me. It will clearly show that these imperfections are barely visible (even to the trained eye of a lumberman). The dimensions are : Width = 31 1/4\", Depth = 11\"; Height = 60\" (if you decide to make two racks that hold 60 bottles each, the height would then be 30\") If you have any tipping concerns, ask for your free \"earthquake strap\". Additionally, Don't forget to request an exchange of LARGER (champagne, 1.5 litre) shelves for regular shelves in multiples (set) of two (2), if it's a benefit to you.

The double wall creates a thermal effect, helping to keep your cold drinks cold and your hot drinks hot for longer periods of time. These mouth blown glasses are an exciting product for any home, restaurant and cafe and they are a definite conversation piece. Bodum's insulated glassware is made from durable Borosilicate glass. Borosilicate glass is a strong heat-resistant glass traditionally used to make scientific lab glass. Stronger than traditional \"soda-lime\" glass, borosilicate can be used for everything from drinkware to cookware. Borosilicate glass substitutes boron oxide in place of the soda and lime used in everyday glassware. The boron oxide acts as the glue holding the silicate together. Due to small size of boron particles, the glass is held together tighter, resulting in a stronger, lighter glass. Borosilicate glass doesn't need to be as thick as traditional glass to be just as strong due to the bonding capability boron oxide. Borosilicate is simply a different type of glass that is resistant to temperature swings and scratching. Because the particles are held together so tightly, borosilicate glass is resistant to temperature swings, In addition to being dishwasher safe borosilicate will not become cloudy over time; you can rest assured that after 1,000 cycles, the glass will be as clear as the day you bought it.", "salesrank_2018": "8898"}, "B004NBXUWC": {"description": "The need for functional storage is great in many homes.

Within minutes, they can engorge themselves with blood and reach three times their size. The resulting bite will manifest itself as an open sore, pussy blister, rash or hives and the subsequent itching is incessant. The broken skin and exposed sores can lead to varied levels of infection. Combined with other airborne allergens, bed bugs can trigger an asthma attack. Allergic reactions to the saliva injection can, in extreme cases, result in a multi-system allergic reaction and lead to death.

Choose from a combination of more than 200 colors, styles and sizes and Stand In Comfort. At Home in Any Space Finally, you can spend time preparing meals in the kitchen, starting the day at the bathroom mirror, or even ironing clothes, all in complete comfort. Any room in your home where you stand on hard flooring for an extended period of time can cause fatigue and discomfort in the feet, legs and lower back. GelPro Mats are here to change all that. With their durable top fabric, shock-absorbing gel core, non-slip bottom, GelPro Mats are an appropriate accessory for every room in your home where you have hard flooring. GelPro Mats are a perfect fit for your kitchen, bathroom, laundry room/utility room, garage, game room, and/or wine room/cellar. Quality Comfort The foundation upon which GelPro Mats are built is a proprietary shock-absorbing gel core that is the result of countless hours of development and hundreds of prototypes. The soft gel is engineered to distribute your weight evenly, providing a more intimate support platform and maximum comfort.   A great fit for any room in the house.  GelPro Mats can be distinguished from traditional anti-fatigue mats in two distinct ways. The first is the unabashed attention paid to the quality of the top fabrics used on GelPro Mats. The second distinguishing characteristic is the material used as the support mechanism at the center of GelPro Mats. GelPro uses gel, while other mats use foam. When you step on a foam mat, your weight typically stays in one spot as the foam compresses making the mat harder at the point of contact. A GelPro Mat, by contrast, contours to your feet as weight is applied and pushes evenly the entire time you are on the mat. This contouring characteristic takes place instantaneously each time you step on your GelPro Mat and continues throughout the duration of your time on the mat. GelPro's unique gel core design has redefined the floor mat category and has earned accolades from industry experts and consumers alike.   Versatile, durable, and easy to clean.  Traction Careful consideration has gone into every component of GelPro Mats with the goal of providing maximum comfort at the forefront. From the soft, luxurious top fabrics, to the ergonomically engineered gel core, each component of the GelPro Mat was selected, in part, for its cushioning effect. Even the non-slip fabric on the bottom of each mat is soft and supple offering a comforting element. GelPro's non-slip bottom is made from a durable polyester knit base fabric that is non-irritating. It also contains an anti-static compatibility ingredient that limits the mats movement on most hard flooring surfaces. Fabric Simply put, the top fabric on GelPro Mats is without peer. From the expert craftsmanship, to the intricate patterns, to the vibrant colors, no other floor mat on the market combines comfort, style and durability the way GelPro Mats do. Each fabric must pass a rigorous testing process and rise to the GelPro standards for sustainability in climate, strength and longevity before it is considered for inclusion on GelPro Mats. Only the highest quality fabrics pass the GelPro testing process. GelPro Mats are made from the world's finest composite fabrics resulting in mats that are more versatile, more durable and easier to clean.

At Home in Any Space Finally, you can spend time preparing meals in the kitchen, starting the day at the bathroom mirror, or even ironing clothes, all in complete comfort. Any room in your home where you stand on hard flooring for an extended period of time can cause fatigue and discomfort in the feet, legs and lower back. GelPro Mats are here to change all that. With their durable top fabric, shock-absorbing gel core, non-slip bottom, GelPro Mats are an appropriate accessory for every room in your home where you have hard flooring. GelPro Mats are a perfect fit for your kitchen, bathroom, laundry room/utility room, garage, game room, and/or wine room/cellar. Quality Comfort The foundation upon which GelPro Mats are built is a proprietary shock-absorbing gel core that is the result of countless hours of development and hundreds of prototypes. The soft gel is engineered to distribute your weight evenly, providing a more intimate support platform and maximum comfort.   A great fit for any room in the house.  GelPro Mats can be distinguished from traditional anti-fatigue mats in two distinct ways. The first is the unabashed attention paid to the quality of the top fabrics used on GelPro Mats. The second distinguishing characteristic is the material used as the support mechanism at the center of GelPro Mats. GelPro uses gel, while other mats use foam. When you step on a foam mat, your weight typically stays in one spot as the foam compresses making the mat harder at the point of contact. A GelPro Mat, by contrast, contours to your feet as weight is applied and pushes evenly the entire time you are on the mat. This contouring characteristic takes place instantaneously each time you step on your GelPro Mat and continues throughout the duration of your time on the mat. GelPro's unique gel core design has redefined the floor mat category and has earned accolades from industry experts and consumers alike.   Versatile, durable, and easy to clean.  Traction Careful consideration has gone into every component of GelPro Mats with the goal of providing maximum comfort at the forefront. From the soft, luxurious top fabrics, to the ergonomically engineered gel core, each component of the GelPro Mat was selected, in part, for its cushioning effect. Even the non-slip fabric on the bottom of each mat is soft and supple offering a comforting element. GelPro's non-slip bottom is made from a durable polyester knit base fabric that is non-irritating. It also contains an anti-static compatibility ingredient that limits the mats movement on most hard flooring surfaces. Fabric Simply put, the top fabric on GelPro Mats is without peer. From the expert craftsmanship, to the intricate patterns, to the vibrant colors, no other floor mat on the market combines comfort, style and durability the way GelPro Mats do. Each fabric must pass a rigorous testing process and rise to the GelPro standards for sustainability in climate, strength and longevity before it is considered for inclusion on GelPro Mats. Only the highest quality fabrics pass the GelPro testing process. GelPro Mats are made from the world's finest composite fabrics resulting in mats that are more versatile, more durable and easier to clean. Cordoba Cordoba is a more intricate variant of the interwoven Basketweaver pattern. Familiar and clean in design, it conveys a relaxed comfort appreciated by all.

This long-staple allows the cotton to be woven more extensively, creating a softer and more durable sheet that is resistant to pilling.

Most importantly, convection heat is safer than other forms of heating because only the outside surface gets warm. The heating elements are not exposed, meaning the heater itself will never get hot enough to burn you and will never come in contact with flammable objects around it. Convection Heaters are also environmentally safe since they do not use oil to create heat. A sleek design and stylish finishes make this space heater stand out from the rest.

Sometimes, making a simple soup can be hard work. Immersion blenders are supposed to make cooking easier, but they can often create problems instead of solving them: creating splatters, suctioning to the bottom of the bowl, and scratching pots. How can you control the power you need to get the texture you want? The Breville Control Grip immersion blender has a redesigned blade system to address these problems: a bell-shaped base and internal ribbing break suction for greater control and efficient blending. This is how the Breville Control Grip stands apart: whatever you need to blend, the Breville Control Grip has got it under control. New design for excellent performance The Breville Control Grip\u2019s blade system has internal ribs that create turbulence. This unique system makes sure the food falls onto the blades, reducing suction to the bottom of the pot. It also gives you precise control over texture, with 15 variable speeds, while the 8 inch immersion depth for large quantities or tall pots means that you can blend directly in the pot for less mess and more convenience. No more transferring soups from the pot to the food processor and back. The powerful 280 watt motor generates circulation, making sure all the ingredients are blended evenly. These features make the Breville Control Grip excellent for multi-tasking, whether it\u2019s blending, emulsifying, whipping, or pureeing. Use it to make velvety soups, thick mayonnaise, fluffy whipped cream, chunky pesto, dips, and salsa, smoothies, baby food and more. Get a grip on excellent blending The Breville Control Grip features an ergonomically optimized handle designed to fit your hand comfortably. Trigger operation keeps your hand in natural position for more stability and control, and its soft touch finish makes sure it\u2019s easy on your hand, even when it\u2019s hard on your food. Designed with the Consumer in Mind With all of these features, it\u2019s no wonder that the Breville Control Grip has been rated the best immersion blender by a leading consumer magazine, beating out higher priced models. It\u2019s built with high quality materials: both the blending shaft and the ice-crushing blades are made of stainless steel, ensuring durability. A 6 foot extra-long power cord makes the unit portable and convenient, providing the mobility of a cordless immersion blender but making sure that it is always ready to go when you need it (no charging necessary). The bottom of the blender has a non-scratch base to prevent it from scratching your non-stick pots. It also comes with a handy whisk attachment for cream, egg whites, or light batters, as well as a blending jug and chopping bowl. The chopping bowl can be stored compactly in the jug for convenience and the lid of the blending jug can be used as a base to prevent slipping while blending. Easy clean parts can be hand washed and most parts (except motor, chopper lid and whisk gear box) can be washed in the dish washer on the top shelf only, making cleanup quick and easy.

They\u2019re restored to a fully functional condition. In short, they are everything a Dyson machine should be- they work properly and don\u2019t lose suction. Dyson refurbishes vacuums that are returned to us by retailers or consumers. Refurbishing these machines, rather than disposing of them, means that the parts and materials are re-used instead of wasted.  When a machine comes to us to be refurbished, it is first stripped down as far as necessary. Components removed from the machine that meet our high standards of quality are kept and cleaned. Most damaged or broken components are sent away for recycling. The core of the machine is thoroughly cleaned and new parts are added to replace damaged or cosmetically unacceptable parts discovered during the stripping down process.  Just like our brand new machines, the rebuilt machine then undergoes a comprehensive series of electrical and performance tests to ensure that it works as it should. For our vacuums, one of the tests carried out is a suction test. All refurbished vacuums are electrically tested in compliance with electrical and safety requirements. One of the primary differences between a new Dyson machine and a refurbished Dyson machine is its appearance\u2013 a scratch here or there or a slightly clouded bin may provide a clue that it has been previously used. After it has passed all of the tests, the machine is then packaged and sent out. All Dyson refurbished vacuums come with a 6 month parts and labor warranty.  The Dyson DC27 Total Clean Refurbished is a powerful upright vacuum cleaner for all floor types. It weighs just 19.9 pounds with no compromise in durability.

Stop settling for mediocre, vending machine drinks and snacks and take the first important step toward a healthy lifestyle with the Hamilton Beach Smoothie Smart Blender. Your body will be glad you did. Designed to blend the perfect fruit or vegetable smoothie, the Smoothie Smart Blender delivers on the blending and ice-crushing power people want most, instead of skimping on performance. And unlike other blenders with confusing buttons that keep you guessing, this blender's one-touch functionality keeps things simple. You simply press the Smoothie button and walk away. The blender's unique, 45-second smoothie cycle handles the rest. The patented Wave-Action system is designed to pull the ingredients down into the stainless steel blades for smooth results without ice chunks \u2013 no stirring needed. For easy cleanup afterwards, any mess on its smooth, metal touchpad is quickly wiped away and its cord stores neatly out of sight. All things considered \u2013 for a blender that boasts no guesswork, stirring or mess \u2013 you'll wonder why you ever settled for fast-food snacks and chunky smoothies in the first place.  PRODUCT FEATURES  One-touch, automatic SMOOTHIE button activates the smart, 45-second blending cycle with automatic shutoff Lets you blend the perfect smoothie for breakfast, lunch, dinner or snackICE CRUSH button activates automatic pulsing action with 1 second ON and 1 second OFF until the STOP button is pushedEquipped with five blending functions: SMOOTHIE, ICE CRUSH, HI, MED, LOW and PULSE 700 watts of peak power for excellent blending performancePatented Wave~Action system ensures perfect results every time without stirringStainless steel Ice Sabre blades are performance-tested for heavy-duty ice crushingHeat-resistant 40-oz. glass jar is thermal shock tested to withstand extreme temperature changes and won't absorb food odors, stains or scratch Patented no-mess pouring spout eliminates drips Easy-clean smooth touchpad wipes clean quickly Easy-clean smooth touchpad wipes clean quickly Durable motor is life-tested to blend 8,000 frozen drinksDishwasher safe jar, blades and lid  Makes the Perfect Smoothie Every Time  Tired of boring smoothies or frozen drinks that taste like they came from a slushy machine or pre-packaged cocktail mix? Invest in a reliable blending machine that yields great-tasting, smooth drinks every time you blend. With the Smoothie Smart Blender, making an enviously perfect smoothie is as simple as adding ingredients to the jar, pushing the SMOOTHIE button and walking away. That's right, there's no need to stop and watch or \"shake and stir\" mid-way through blending. The Smoothie Smart Blender's 45-second SMOOTHIE cycle is programmed to combine the right number of pulses and speeds to yield perfectly smooth drinks. Offers Almost Endless Drink Variety Mixing up your blending routine with alternative blender drinks like milkshakes, icy drinks or frozen cocktails can be the perfect way to get more use out of your blender, personalize your recipes and try out restaurant-style cocktails at a fraction of the price. Offering five blending options, SMOOTHIE, ICE CRUSH, HI, MED, LO and PULSE, the Smoothie Smart Blender crushes ice efficiently and lets you add a wide variety of ingredients to create your own delicious drink concoctions. To make a milkshake, simply add milk and ice cream to the jar and mix on LO speed for 5 to 10 seconds. To create frozen drinks, be sure to add liquids first, then ice cubes. Press the ICE CRUSH button to automatically activate the high-speed pulsing action. Once ice is crushed, press HI to blend the drink and press STOP when your frozen drink is finished. Crushes Ice Effortlessly  The ability to crush ice quickly and get smooth drinks every time is a big factor in deciding whether to order one from a restaurant or blend your own at home. Luckily, the Smoothie Smart Blender isn't your average blender. It doesn't cut corners when it comes to whipping up perfect, chunk-free drinks in minimal time. The heavy-duty crushing power of the Ice Sabre blades was tested by crushing two tons of ice. The durable motor is life-tested to blend 8,000 frozen drinks. Think an average blender or refrigerator door can spit out finely crushed ice as well as this blender? Think again. Blends Hot Liquids, Soups, Salsas & Dips Functioning as a multi-purpose blender, the Smoothie Smart Blender is more than just a perfect smoothie maker. It's also great for blending hot liquids, pur\u00e9eing vegetables into soups and making homemade salsa. What's more, the clear 40-oz. glass jar gives you visibility over what ingredients are going into the jar and watch how they're being blended, so you can control your blending action. To blend hot liquids, add liquids to the jar first, then solid ingredients. Start blending at the lowest speed, taking care to hold the lid with an oven mitt. To blend salsa and dip, cut foods in small pieces and use a gentle pulsing action, waiting for the blades to stop between pulses.  Makes Healthy Living Convenient & Easy What could be better than a perfect smoothie for breakfast or mid-day snack? Breakfast isn't called the most important meal of the day without good cause; eating a good breakfast can jump-start your day, giving you the nutrients and energy you need. Why not make a smoothie--one of the most popular drinks to make in a blender--your breakfast? Less Cleaning, More Enjoying Skip the hassle of messy blender cleanup by opting for a low-maintenance machine that's as conscious about cleaning as you are. The lid, jar and blades are dishwasher safe and what's more, the Smoothie Smart Blender has a no-mess pouring spout that directs drink contents into your cup, instead of dripping down the sides of the jar or all over the counter. For easy cleanup afterwards, any mess on its smooth touchpad is quickly wiped away and its cord stores neatly out of sight.  TIPS AND CARE  Remember to always add liquids FIRST, and then add frozen items, ice cubes or solid ingredients. For the best performance, the minimum amount of liquid needed per recipe is one cup (8 ounces/250 ml). Add more liquid if your mixture is not blending properly. If blending action stops during blending or ingredients stick to the sides of the jar, turn blender OFF. Remove lid and use rubber spatula to push mixture toward blades. While the Smoothie Smart Blender is powerful, it's not designed to process stiff dough, whip egg whites, grind raw meat or extract juices from produce.

View larger.  Yaxell Knives: The Ran Series The outstanding edge of the Yaxell knife has been achieved by combining the best of advanced technology with the unsurpassed knowledge and expertise of the craftspeople making these professional kitchen knives. Their skills have been cultivated in traditional Japanese sword-making techniques handed down from generation to generation over seven centuries in Seki, Japan, the capital of swords and knives. \"Ran\" means \"the excellent\" in Japanese.   Choose from an array of styles and sizes. View larger.  Special Heat Treatment Through Accurate Temperature Control Yaxell blades are heated in a kiln to a very high temperature and then ice hardened. Then they are again tempered using a high temperature to make the blade strong and curable with long-lasting performance. At the same time, this special heat treatment makes the blade corrosion-resistant. The blade is hardened to Rockwell 60-61 degrees for RAN 69 knives.      Benefits of Damascus Multi-Layered Steel:      Hard Corrosion resistant     Extremely sharp edge Long-lasting performance   Damascus multi-layered steel is specially designed for high-quality blades. It was designed to maintain sharpness and durability without becoming brittle. Damascus multi-layered steel is extremely sharp and will take and keep its sharp edge much longer than other types of steel. Damascus multi-layered steel is made by cladding a core steel called VG10 with layers of a more flexible stainless steel, leaving just the cutting edge of the VG10 steel exposed. The result of this \"sandwiched\" blade is a tough blade that can take an exquisitely keen edge. Durable Blade with a Sharp Edge   Exclusive tempering and hardening process for long-lasting sharpness. View larger.  The core material VG10 \"super steel\" is composed of cobalt, molybdenum, vanadium, and carbon. VG10 stainless steel is clad with 34 layers of soft and hard high-carbon stainless steel on each side, producing the 69 layered, rust-resistant Damascus look. The blade also has an extremely sharp cutting-angle. Our special heat treatment gives our blades the outstanding hardness rating of HRC61 on the Rockwell scale, ensuring long-lasting cutting performance. Ergonomic, Riveted Handle   Dual-riveted ergonomic handle provides a secure grip. View larger.  The handle is constructed of FDA-approved black canvas micarta, an odorless, enormously durable material made of resin and linen. The material lasts decades. The break-resistant handle features a full, sturdy 18-10 tang (no corrosion); resists heat up 302 degrees F (150 degrees C); and provides a stainless-steel capped end, which gives the knife outstanding stability. Two stainless-steel rivets fasten the handle tightly.

Inspired by his personal experiences at home and abroad, Enrico Guzzini initially set out to relaunch an ancient craft by producing elegant ox horn items. Later, a younger Guzzini generation began to craft household items from Plexiglas. Reaching it\u2019s next milestone in the 1960\u2019s, Raimondo Guzzini began to create a more open approach to business with the introduction of moulded acrylics while focusing on creative design concepts. By the 1980\u2019s Fratelli Guzzini began to shape into the company that it is known for today by introducing color and a creative incorporation of various materials like porcelain and glass. With many awards from all over the world, some of Guzzini\u2019s collections are showcased at the Museum of Modern Art in New York as well as the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.

Getting the Best Results  \u2022 Small Particles: Some fine particles can restrict airflow very quickly and will decrease performance even before the dust container appears full.

It may be beneficial to use the stair cleaning grip while cleaning stairs. \u2022 Brushroll: Long hair, thread, string, etc. can wrap around the revolving brushroll and result in reduced performance. To check brushroll for debris turn cleaner nozzle over and inspect for wrapped matter. Use scissors to cut debris from brushroll. \u2022 Cleaning the dust cup: Remove the dust cup, shake and brush the dust and dirt from the filter inside.
