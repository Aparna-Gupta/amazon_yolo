This vacuum-insulated 16-ounce travel mug features a patented AUTOSEAL lid, making it leak-proof and spill-resistant yet easy to use and hold. The mug fits most car cup-holders and single-serve brewers, and features a dishwasher-safe lid that hinges open for easy cleaning.  AUTOSEAL Technology - Automatically seals between sips! The leak-proof and spill-resistant AUTOSEAL lid automatically seals between sips, protecting against leaks and spills. There is no lid to remove or spout to open, so it is great for one-handed, on-the-go drinking whether commuting, hiking, or just dealing with a busy day. Simply press the button to drink and then release to seal between sips. And because the lid system is always closed unless activated, your beverages will remain hotter and colder for longer periods of time.  Vacuum-insulation for maximum temperature retention          Made from durable stainless steel, the mug has a vacuum-insulated double wall, ensuring that hot beverages stay hot and cool beverages stay cool. The mug's vacuum-insulation keeps beverages hot for up to 4 hours and cold for up to 12 hours. The double-wall construction not only retains temperature, but also prevents external condensation from forming so table tops remain free from moisture. The mug measures 3 inches in diameter by 7.25 inches tall, and weighs approximately 10.8 ounces.   Flow-control lid design for convenient sipping      Easy to Clean  The mug's newly engineered drink spout gives you more control over the flow of your beverage: tip the mug slightly to take a small sip, or tilt it further for a more robust drink.  The unique reservoir-shaped spout will also enhance your beverage's flavor, as the lid allows the beverage's aroma to hit the open air briefly before entering your mouth. Dishwasher-safe lid hinges open for easy cleaning This 16-ounce Contigo travel mug features an amazingly easy-to-clean lid. The lid's button and interior AUTOSEAL mechanism hinge open, allowing for exceptional water flow and full accessibility and visibility during the cleaning process. The lid is top-rack dishwasher safe. Good for the Environment By using this Contigo product, you're both helping the environment and also saving money by taking your coffee, tea, water or juice with you in a reusable container instead of buying cups or water bottles as you go. Research shows that coffee drinkers can save nearly 23 pounds of paper cup waste by toting around their own reusable mug. Caring for Your Contigo For easy care, the Contigo lid is top-rack dishwasher safe.  It is recommended to hand wash the mug body to protect the finish. Always store the mug with its lid removed to prevent moisture from becoming trapped in the body or lid after washing. Do not keep liquids that spoil easily, such as dairy, in the mug for prolonged periods.  About Contigo Knowing that on-the-go beverages can be messy and complicated to use, Contigo developed a line of simple, yet functionally innovative drinkware to help people face life's daily challenges.

Rest easy; Air Cork protects your wine from oxidation while allowing you to enjoy your wine tonight and tomorrow and the day after tomorrow. Air Cork is intuitive, simple and easy to use. It provides an airtight seal no matter how much wine is left in the bottle. To use, lower the balloon end into the bottle until it reaches the top surface of the wine. As you pump, the balloon floats and seals itself to the side of the bottle to provide an air tight seal from the inside of the bottle. When you're ready to enjoy another glass, simply squeeze the valve until the balloon completely deflates. Lift it out of the bottle, blot it dry or rinse it off. Inflating the balloon until 1-1/2 Inch is showing as pressed to the bottle side should inhibit oxidation and keep your wine at its peak for about 3 days. The Air Cork allows you to avoid losing the beautiful aromatics of your wine or pouring into smaller bottles to eliminate excess air when storing your wine, all while seeing that it's working from outside of the bottle. The balloon is manufactured in the USA and is constructed of natural rubber latex, a bio based elastomer material. All ingredients in the balloon meet US FDA standards for food contact. In no way will it affect or alter the taste of your wine. The Air Cork is designed for standard wine bottles only; 750-ml bottles or smaller. Enjoying your wine within 3 days of opening is recommended.

The details hand sanded into this Abstract Metal Wall Art & Sculpture capture the interplay of highlights and shadows and creates a three dimensional sense of movement as you view it from different angles. Pictures do not do it justice since the highlights and shadows change as you move around it. I hand polish and grind the textures into the metal to create dramatic illusions of depth and dimension. The silver reflections will be especially appreciated in person as you and your guests marvel as the brilliant glimmering light seems to interact with the metal as you move around it. Each piece is meticulously fabricated when the order is placed and will vary slightly from the photos shown (the new pieces always look better than the photos). I use the highest grade materials to bring many years of enjoyment and mounting brackets are installed to allow hanging on any surface. It usually takes about 7-10 working days to create the piece and allow it to dry completely before shipping. Mounting brackets and hardware are included along with easy to follow mounting instructions.", "salesrank_2018": "2481279"}, "B0083V8YVA": {"description": "    Why choose Core Bamboo? Core Bamboo is the proud manufacturer of the world's finest bamboo products. All of our products are made by our experienced team of hard working artisans in a safe and responsible environment. We take great pride not only in the outstanding quality of our products but also in the environment in which they are made. Every product that bears our name was made in an ethically and socially responsible way. About our Bamboo Bamboo is one of the most remarkable resources on Earth. As a member of the grass family, not a tree, it grows at a much quicker rate than any other wood. From start to harvest (60-70 feet tall) it can take just four years. Bamboo is also one of the lightest materials available. Bamboo is 16% stronger than Maple and is 33% lighter in weight than oak. What is probably most remarkable is its unique extensive root system. When bamboo is harvested its natural root system spreads and automatically regenerates itself. Virtually all of the bamboo we harvest is used in the process. When we harvest the bamboo stalk at 70 feet it is cut up and divided into different production materials. The bottom section is primarily used for flooring and building materials. These are usually the toughest and hardest pieces to bend. The middle section is used by our factories to make lovely handcrafted products ranging from our assorted boards to versatile bowls and everything in between. The top section is used for smaller thinner items such as chop sticks, and accessory items. Even the sawdust created during the cutting is collected and mixed in with other materials to create a concrete like substance used for building and fixing a variety of items.  Eco-Friendly   FSC Certified  Socially Responsible Bamboo is a 100% renewable resource which does not need re-planting, extensive irrigation, pesticides or fertilizer. When bamboo is harvested its natural root system spreads and automatically regenerates itself.  FDA Approved   Panda Safe  FDA Approved All of our bamboo products are certified by the Food and Drug Administration to be safe for use for food. We have designed our collection of bamboo products to be used for food preparation and presentation, from our cutting boards and utensils, to our beautiful serving bowls and trays. Enjoy using our products to prep and serve all of your favorite cuisines. FSC Certified All of our products are certified by the FSC. The Forest Stewardship Council protects and ensures that products with the FSC label uphold principles and criteria which bring the highest social and environmental benefits during harvesting. This brings direct benefits to the forests from which we harvest our bamboo, including protecting biodiversity, worker's rights, and areas that have environmental or cultural significance.  Bacterial Fighting   Knife Friendly  Panda Safe The species of bamboo used in the production of our products is not a food source or a habitat for the Giant Panda. There are many types of bamboo that pandas eat, and we proudly use bamboo that does not impact the livelihood of this wonderful animal. Natural Bacterial Fighting Properties Scientists found that bamboo has a unique anti-bacterial bio-agent known as \"bamboo Kun\" which allows bamboo to thrive naturally in the wild without any pesticide. Knife Friendly Bamboo is the perfect material for food preparation. It is 16% stronger than Maple and 33% lighter in weight than oak. This substantial, yet light-weight material does not dull knives. Care and use We recommend that our bamboo products are hand washed with light soap and warm water and periodically coated with mineral oil to bring out the beautiful grain of the bamboo. We don't recommend using this product in the dishwasher or microwave. Prolonged soaking is also not recommended.

Conventional cookware and other ceramic cookware brands achieve their non-stick performance through a coating of PTFE (PolyTetraFluoroEthylene), a synthetic substance that has waxy properties. At very high temperatures, PTFE begins to decompose and release fumes which are documented to be lethal to birds and small pets, and which can be harmful to humans. In addition, traditional cookware incorporating PTFE is often manufactured with the aid of PFOA (PerFluoroOctanoic Acid), which the EPA has classified as a 'persistent pollutant of the environment'. With the Green Earth Wok's ecozeri technology, even under high temperatures, such harmful toxic fumes are never released into the environment. This is because the Green Earth Wok by Ozeri utilizes a 100% ceramic coating inspired by nature. The Green Earth Wok's ceramic coating is completely free of PTFE and PFOA. In addition to being eco-friendly and ultra-safe, the Green Earth Wok's ceramic coating is far more durable and scratch-resistant than other non-stick surfaces. With better non-stick properties, the Green Earth Wok by Ozeri allows you to saute, fry, bake, boil and braise with as little as half the amount of oil normally used, and it makes cleaning a breeze.

Best of all, the Twister jar is compatible with all Blendtec consumer blenders. To use the jar, simply add ingredients and twist the lid counter-clockwise while the blend cycle is running. This twisting motion forces the ingredients from the sides of the jar back into the blade, allowing you to achieve a perfect blend every time. Also included is the Spectacular spatula\u2014engineered specifically for the Twister. We made this spatula just the right length and shape so you can get nearly every morsel out of your jar. Features include all of these unique Blendtec advantages:  Patented Twister lid Mini Gripper lid for containing thinner blends Patented single-prong tuned wingtip blade Easy-to-read jar markings up to 16 fl oz Durable BPA-free material that stands up to heavy use Compatible with all Blendtec consumer blenders, not compatible with Blendtec mixers. 3-Year Warranty          Anatomy of the Twister    THICK, THICKER, THICKEST IF you could blend cream cheese, would you? How about nut butters? Hummus? If you think it's too thick, it's probably not. Not for the Blendtec Twister jar. The secret is the patent-pending Twister lid featuring tines that run along the inner side of the jar. As the blade forces ingredients onto the side of the jar, you simply twist the lid to scrape the ingredients back into the lid blending vortex. The result is fast blending of thick ingredients, without stopping to scrape the sides manually. It also comes with a Gripper lid to contain thinner, single-serve blends.              STAINLESS STEEL \u2013 THE PROFESSIONAL'S CHOICE Blendtec's ultra-hard stainless steel blades are cold-forged and tuned for heavy use. This allows them to be stronger and resist corrosion much better than lesser blades. SINGLE BLADE, MANY ADVANTAGES Blendtec's patented vertical wingtips and precision angles are engineered for ultimate efficiency. The distinct single-blade design allows your ingredients to fall easily in front of the blades.      NO DETAIL TOO SMALL Even the smallest parts in a Blendtec product have received big attention from our engineers. Blade assembly nut Round and smooth for easy cleaning\u2014and\u2014permanently attached at the factory \u2013 adding to jar safety. Bearing assembly Sonically welded into the jar for extra strength and durability.               THE FIGHT AGAINST FRICTION Friction is the nemesis of all high-powered equipment. Ball bearings reduce friction so you can blend faster and quieter. It's all surrounded by a rubber mount that absorbs the shock produced by blending ice and frozen fruit.

Included single wall filters provide a more challenging experience for those who have already mastered the art of espresso Why the Breville BES840XL Infuser Espresso Machine? For espresso with a well-balanced flavor, flavor needs to be drawn evenly from all the coffee grinds. What is the best way to prepare the grinds for an even extraction? Rather than starting with bursts of high pressure, the Breville Infuser Espresso Machine starts with steady, low pressure to gently expand the grinds. This helps fills in any cracks, gaps, or irregularities in the coffee puck before full pressure is applied, so even pressure is applied to all parts of the coffee puck and optimal flavor is extracted. BES840XL Features The BES840XL has both automatic features, like temperature settings, and programmable features like volumetric control. The key features that set it apart from other espresso machines in its price range are the pre-infusion technology, the thermocoil heating system, and PID temperature control technology. See chart below for details. Other helpful features include a cup warmer on the top of the machine and a feature that removes excess water from the filter basket after coffee extraction, so the used grounds form a dry puck for quicker cleanup. The machine goes into 'Sleep Mode' after 1 hour and automatically shuts off after 3 hours. There is extra-tall cup clearance for brewing directly into travel mugs. Other touches include an \u2018Empty Me!\u2019 indicator that lets you know when the removable drip tray is full and a \u2018Clean Me\u2019 cleaning alert. The storage tray houses the included accessories. Lastly, all parts that come in contact with water and coffee are BPA free.   Click on image to view larger Product Features   The 61 fl. oz. (1.8 L) removable water tank is a top-fill tank with a handle. It has a replaceable water filter to reduce impurities and scale. The 1600W thermocoil heating system circulates the water through a heated coil, heating water \u2018on demand\u2019 for better temperature consistency. It also uses PID technology to regulate the temperature. A 54mm stainless steel portafilter with commercial style spouts and a 54mm tamper are also included for expert tamping control. The tamper is stored magnetically on the machine, but is easily removable for tamping. The dry puck feature removes excess water from the ground coffee in the filter basket for easy disposal of the coffee puck. The espresso pressure gauge helps you monitor espresso extraction pressure, so you know whether the espresso is being over- or under-extracted. The volumetric control functionlets you set shot volumes. Use either the preset volumes or manually over-ride them with your own preferences. Once you figure out what volumes you prefer, you can program it to remain at your customized setting.

Using Hamilton Beach Stainless Steel Deep Fryer 35200 is a way toward preparing healthy, tasty food. The idea that deep fried foods are unhealthy is a myth if you know how to deep fry. The key to healthier fried foods lies in the temperature of the oil. If the oil isn't hot enough to cook the food quickly, the food absorbs excess oil and fat. If the oil is too hot, components in the oil begin to break down. This produces off-flavors and can produce toxic compounds in the oil. Heat the oil to the right temperature, usually 350 to 375 degrees Fahrenheit and the food will absorb little excess oil. Do not fry frozen foods, allow them to warm to room temperature. Use olive oil to get the healthier fat components. Keeping the oil at a steady temperature means foods may be fried and remain healthy. This Hamilton Beach deep fryer features an immersed heating element for even oil heating, plus a 30-minute timer and automatic shutoff. It's ideal for quick and easy deep frying and holds up to 8 cups. Choosing what to fry, how to fry and what oil to use help make the Hamilton Beach Stainless Steel Deep Fryer 35200 a great buy. This 8-cup stainless steel deep fryer will create the perfect crispy golden foods from chicken wings to potato fries.

Because it cleans under beds, couches, and other hard-to-reach areas, it actually vacuums more of the floor than a standard upright can.

Breville Certified Remanufactured Products are returned Breville products that have been inspected, remanufactured, and repackaged for sale. They are returned to Breville by retailers and may or may not have been previously used or purchased by a consumer. While only some products are returned due to technical issues, all products undergo Breville's stringent quality-assurance and remanufacturing process. By purchasing a Breville Certified Remanufactured Product you should expect Breville performance at a discounted price. In order for a Breville product to be considered Certified Remanufactured, it must be fully inspected, cleaned, and tested to Breville's remanufacturing standards before being offered for sale. Each Breville Certified Remanufactured Product is fully cleaned and tested to ensure any identified defective components are replaced with original Breville replacement parts. Each product is inspected to Breville quality-assurance standards and, if it passes, is then repackaged into a new box bearing the \"Certified Remanufactured\u201d logo. All Certified Remanufactured Products are 100 percent functional to Breville factory specifications but may exhibit some minor cosmetic imperfections, such as scratches, marks, or discolorations. What is the difference between Breville Certified Remanufactured and Refurbished products? The certified remanufactured program requires each unit to be broken down into its individual units and reconstructed, ensuring that the finished product is of the highest possible quality. Refurbished programs do not necessarily go through this process. Before this process, each unit is vigorously tested to pinpoint the source of error before rebuilding so the problem can be targeted as accurately as possible. What happens to returned products that fail to meet Breville's stringent remanufacturing and quality-assurance processes? As a sustainable corporation, Breville is committed to minimizing landfill associated with returned products. Products that fail to meet Breville's standards are de-manufactured down to the component and/or material level to be recycled.

Core Bamboo is the proud manufacturer of the world's finest bamboo products. All of our products are made by our experienced team of hard working artisans in a safe and responsible environment. We take great pride not only in the outstanding quality of our products but also in the environment in which they are made. Every product that bears our name was made in an ethically and socially responsible way.  About our Bamboo Bamboo is one of the most remarkable resources on Earth. As a member of the grass family, not a tree, it grows at a much quicker rate than any other wood. From start to harvest (60-70 feet tall) it can take just four years. Bamboo is also one of the lightest materials available. Bamboo is 16% stronger than Maple and is 33% lighter in weight than oak. What is probably most remarkable is its unique extensive root system. When bamboo is harvested its natural root system spreads and automatically regenerates itself.  Virtually all of the bamboo we harvest is used in the process. When we harvest the bamboo stalk at 70 feet it is cut up and divided into different production materials. The bottom section is primarily used for flooring and building materials. These are usually the toughest and hardest pieces to bend. The middle section is used by our factories to make lovely handcrafted products ranging from our assorted boards to versatile bowls and everything in between. The top section is used for smaller thinner items such as chop sticks, and accessory items. Even the sawdust created during the cutting is collected and mixed in with other materials to create a concrete like substance used for building and fixing a variety of items.   FSC CertifiedSocially Responsible Bamboo is a 100% renewable resource which does not need re-planting, extensive irrigation, pesticides or fertilizer. When bamboo is harvested its natural root system spreads and automatically regenerates itself.  FDA ApprovedPanda SafeFDA Approved All of our bamboo products are certified by the Food and Drug Administration to be safe for use for food. We have designed our collection of bamboo products to be used for food preparation and presentation, from our cutting boards and utensils, to our beautiful serving bowls and trays. Enjoy using our products to prep and serve all of your favorite cuisines. FSC Certified All of our products are certified by the FSC. The Forest Stewardship Council protects and ensures that products with the FSC label uphold principles and criteria which bring the highest social and environmental benefits during harvesting. This brings direct benefits to the forests from which we harvest our bamboo, including protecting biodiversity, worker's rights, and areas that have environmental or cultural significance.  Bacterial Fighting Knife FriendlyPanda Safe The species of bamboo used in the production of our products is not a food source or a habitat for the Giant Panda. There are many types of bamboo that pandas eat, and we proudly use bamboo that does not impact the livelihood of this wonderful animal. Natural Bacterial Fighting Properties Scientists found that bamboo has a unique anti-bacterial bio-agent known as \"bamboo Kun\" which allows bamboo to thrive naturally in the wild without any pesticide. Knife Friendly Bamboo is the perfect material for food preparation. It is 16% stronger than Maple and 33% lighter in weight than oak. This substantial, yet light-weight material does not dull knives.  Care and use We recommend that our bamboo products are hand washed with light soap and warm water and periodically coated with mineral oil to bring out the beautiful grain of the bamboo. We don't recommend using this product in the dishwasher or microwave. Prolonged soaking is also not recommended.

With a slow cooker in your cooking arsenal, coming home to a hot, table-ready dinner is as simple as adding ingredients in the morning.  A slow cooker brings a \u201cno-watch\u201d convenience to preparing meals, but many worry about the hot exteriors when picking up the appliance. The Insulated Programmable Slow Cooker has this problem solved. Its base is insulated to help keep most of the heat on the inside, where it\u2019s needed most. Along with its cool design, the Insulated Programmable Slow Cooker is equipped with a nonstick removable pan that goes on the stovetop for easy browning. More lightweight than traditional stoneware, the aluminum insert pan offers cooks the benefit of fast, even heating on the stovetop and eliminates the need to clean a second pan afterwards.  Not only is the Insulated Programmable Slow Cooker full of smart ideas to make life easier, it was also designed with simple programmability in mind. An intuitive control panel makes setting the time and temperature a simple matter of pressing a few buttons, and the cooker\u2019s even heating performance ensures that meals come out the way you want them to: tender and delicious.  PRODUCT FEATURE BENEFITS  Insulated base has cooler sides than the leading competitorCool-touch base handles  Nonstick pan removes for easy browning and searing on the stovetop6 quart aluminum insert pan fits a 6 lb. chicken or a 4 lb. roast Reduced energy consumption; our most energy-efficient slow cookerSimple programmability with +/- buttons for temperature and large, easy-to-read heat buttons for OFF, HIGH, LOW & WARMThe glass lid is dishwasher safe and the insert pan is nonstick so baked-on foods are wiped away easily Wraparound, even heat cooks food evenly and consistently Questions are supported by a toll-free call center located in the U.S.Backed with a one-year warranty  PRODUCT USES AND DETAILS  Simple Programmability The Insulated Programmable Slow Cooker has simple buttons for selecting the cooking time and temperature and either one can be adjusted anytime, even after you start cooking. During the cooking cycle, the countdown display on the control panel shows the remaining time so you can see it at a glance. When the cooking time is up, the slow cooker automatically switches to WARM. If you forget to turn the slow cooker OFF for any reason, the unit will automatically shut off after 14 hours of total cooking time.  Stovetop Searing  Many recipes recommend browning or searing meat prior to slow cooking. While this step is not required, it can enhance the meal\u2019s flavor. To make browning easy, the Insulated Programmable Slow Cooker has a removable, stovetop-safe pan. This insert pan is made of nonstick aluminum, so it heats quickly and evenly and is perfect for browning. When you brown or sear food, the delicious flavor you start on your stovetop will improve the taste of your finished meal.   Designed by Consumers, For Consumers   At Hamilton Beach, every appliance has to perform well for consumers before it ever makes it onto the shelf. As we design products, we seek out honest feedback and opinions from a variety of sources. Now that\u2019s Good Thinking.\u00ae  Our research revealed that consumers are frustrated with hot surface temperatures on slow cookers. With that in mind, we developed a plastic body with handles that are fully integrated into the design. As a result, the aluminum pan is nestled entirely inside the insulated housing as food cooks, so the sides and the handles remain cooler to the touch.  We also identified several innovation opportunities for the slow cooker\u2019s inside. Traditional crocks are heavy and are not stovetop safe. Since many slow cooker recipes call for browning on the stovetop, people need a separate pan to cook with \u2014 and clean. To avoid that inconvenience, the Insulated Programmable Slow Cooker is equipped with a lighter, stovetop-safe aluminum pan with nonstick performance.  SLOW COOKER TIPS  For those new to the slow cooking method, there are a few things you should know. First, how high you fill the crock (also called the insert pan, stoneware, cookware or vessel) is important. To prevent overcooking, the crock should be filled anywhere from half full up to no more than one inch from the rim. Leave more room when cooking with liquid. When cooking soups or stews, leave a 2-inch (5 cm) space between the top of the crock and the food so the recipe can come to a simmer.  Secondly, lifting the lid during cooking will cause the crock to lose heat and it will take longer for your meal to cook. Unless your recipe specifically calls for stirring, resist lifting the lid. Last but not least, if you want to store leftovers after cooking, do NOT place the entire crock in the refrigerator. Contents will take too long to cool. Instead, divide leftovers into smaller containers and then place in the refrigerator.  Cooking Meat  A slow cooker is great for foods that are not naturally tender, like meat. Similar to braising, slow cookers tenderize meat slowly as it cooks. Cuts such as chuck roast, pork butt, short ribs or chicken thigh produce great results. These are the least-expensive cuts but also the most flavorful. If fat is an issue, refrigerate the contents after cooking and skim off the extra fat before serving. Note: you must thaw frozen meat and poultry before adding it to the slow cooker. Cooking Side Dishes or Dessert  Main courses, soups and \"one-pot\" meals are not the only things that slow cookers are great for preparing. They are also perfect for making side dishes and dessert, especially when your main oven is full. Check out the recipes found at www.HamiltonBeach.com that were developed and tested by the culinary experts in the Hamilton Beach Test Kitchen. How to Adapt Recipes You can convert your favorite recipes to slow cooker recipes if you learn these important differences first:  Liquids do not evaporate in a slow cooker. So unless you are cooking rice, pasta, or beans, reduce amount of liquid to 1/2 of the amount called for in your recipe.Fresh vegetables produce more desirable results than canned and frozen vegetables. Canned and frozen vegetables take less time to cook and can produce overcooked dishes.Potatoes, carrots, onions and garlic should be washed and cut in uniform pieces, then placed in the bottom of the crock. Ground beef should be browned and drained before slow cooking to remove grease.Tender foods such as pasta, asparagus and snow peas should be added in the last hour of cooking.Dairy products such as cheese, milk, and sour cream should be added in the last half hour of cooking.Seafood such as shrimp, scallops, and fish should be added in the last 15-30 minutes of cooking.   Time Conversion Chart Fill your slow cooker at least 2/3 full and use this chart to adapt your recipes:     Conventional Recipe Time   Slow Cooker Time on High   Slow Cooker Time on Low     30 minutes   1.5-2 hours   3-4 hours     1-2 hours   4-5 hours   8-9 hours    CARE AND CLEANING Do not use metal utensils, abrasive cleansers or metal scouring pads on the aluminum insert pan. The glass lid is dishwasher safe. However, as with most aluminum pans and cookware, hand washing is recommended for the aluminum pan. To clean the base, simply wipe it down with a damp cloth. Do not immerse the cord, plug or base in any liquid.

The Sipp line is our newest series of insulated beverage containers that mixes fashion with function. By using a Sipp product instead of a disposable cup, you can help the environment without compromising style. Why Thermos? An ideal choice for people on the go, the Sipp Vacuum Insulated Drink Bottle with Tea Infuser is built to last and loaded with features to make for a more enjoyable drinking experience. Thermos vacuum insulation technology virtually eliminates temperature change within the beverage container by creating an airless space between two stainless steel walls. The result is an insulation layer that performs better than any other. A superior insulated container you can depend on to keep your beverages hotter, colder, fresher, longer. This drink bottle with tea infuser keeps beverages hot for 12 hours or cold for 24, making it a great choice for long days out and about or in the office.  Features and Benefits Constructed with double wall stainless steel, this 16 ounce drink bottle with tea infuser is virtually unbreakable, yet its sleek design is both eye-catching and functional. The specially designed lid features a smooth flow design that helps control the flow of warm liquids. The bottle and lid are dishwasher safe for easy care and use. For tea drinkers, an integrated tea infuser fits right into the bottom of the lid and is perfect for brewing loose leaf tea on the go. The infuser is equipped with ultra-fine mesh to keep tea leaves contained within. It also has pass-through holes at the top so you can leave the infuser attached if you don't have a place to remove and store it. The infuser has a capacity to hold four (4) teaspoons of loose leaf tea. Recommended Tip for Maximum Beverage Enjoyment In order to maximize the incredible insulation technology, it is recommended to either pre-chill or pre-heat the drink bottle just prior to use. This can be accomplished by filling the bottle with cold or hot tap water, attaching the lid and letting it rest for a few minutes. Before you are ready to use, simply empty the water and fill with your favorite beverage. Attaching the lid will further increase the thermal efficiency. Leak-Proof and Worry-Free The Sipp Drink Bottle with Tea Infuser has a locking, leak-proof lid that operates with the push of a button. The lid is made of BPA-free Eastman Tritain copolymer which resists staining and provides durability. And because of the double wall insulation, the stainless steel body stays cool to the touch with hot beverages and condensation-free with cold beverages. The Sipp Vacuum Insulated Drink Bottle with Tea Infuser is made of BPA-free materials and is backed by a five-year limited warranty.

The difference is it's new shut-off valve system. Instead of pushing the grounds to the bottom of the brew carafe, the grounds settle naturally. Instructions: * Set the paper filter into the brewer. * Add coffee and \"boiling\" water, stir and let brew for \"3 minutes\". * Place the Clever Coffee Dripper on top of a mug and watch as it fills with perfectly brewed, perfectly clear coffee in seconds. * Lift the brewer off the mug and the Patented Shut-Off System stops the flow.In essence, the Clever Coffee Dripper combines the best features of French press and filter drip brewing, eliminating the drawbacks of each. With French press brewing, you have control over steeping time, but heat loss and sediment in the cup can be a problem. Brewing with a paper filter is easy and convenient; the problem is lack of control over steeping time (i.e. the coffee begins to drain immediately). By adding a stopper to the filtercone, the Clever Coffee Dripper combines control over steeping time with a sediment-free cup. We call this a \"full immersion brewing\" method.Large size uses #4 filters and holds 18 oz. of grounds and water with an approximate 16 oz. brewed coffee yield.The dripper will fit on cups and thermoses with tops wider than 1.5\" and less than 3.75\" in diameter.

All too often, though, when you get to the bottom of the glass, you end up getting a mouthful of spirit-flavored water rather than your favorite liquor. YUCK!  Fortunately, avoiding this watery problem is as easy as serving your drink on the rocks--literally! Just drop two or three Scotch Rocks Sipping Stones into your glass, pour your drink and enjoy every sip to the fullest. These whiskey stones chill spirits every bit as effectively as ice, but they don't melt and add water to the glass. Scotch Rocks Sipping Stones are made out of 100% natural soapstone, a rock that becomes incredibly cold and takes a long time to lose its chill. As a result, it's the perfect choice of material for whiskey stones. Soapstone is also nontoxic and won't alter the smell or taste of your drink the way that some plastic ice cube alternatives can. The nonporous sipping stones won't even take on the flavor of what you're drinking, so you can rinse them off and drop them in a different drink if you wish! The stones get cold enough for use with just 4 hours in the freezer. Unlike other whiskey stones that are produced with machines, Scotch Rocks Sipping Stones are hand cut. This means that only the absolute best soapstone pieces are used in the construction of our sipping stones, making them longer lasting, smoother and even more attractive to the eye than competitors' products. A great addition to your home bar or a gift for your favorite whiskey or scotch aficionado, Scotch Rocks Sipping Stones are sold in an attractive gift set with full usage instructions.

Juice hard and soft fruits and vegetables, including leafy greens like kale and spinach.  Nutrients in the juice, fiber in the pulp Centrifugal juicers get the job done quickly, but what if you want your juice smooth with some pulp ? That\u2019s where masticating juicers come in. Also known as slow juicers or single auger juicers, they crush and squeeze rather than shredding. That means that it maximizes the amount of nutrients extracted and more of the fiber stays in, making for a delicious glass of thick, smooth juice. Why choose a slow juicer? There are two main types of juicer: centrifugal juicers and slow (or masticating) juicers. Centrifugal juicers work by shredding the fruits and vegetables and then spinning at a high speed to separate the pulp and juice. Slow or masticating juicers crush and grind the fruits and vegetables to extract the juice, then filter out the pulp. They're called slow juicers because they don't spin rapidly, not because it takes a long time to make juice; it only takes minutes to produce juice! Slow juicers produce drier pulp than centrifugal juicers, and extract more juice from leafy greens like kale. Some people have a preference from juice from a slow juicer, since it tends to be less frothy and more thick. Versatility for maximum yield and results Masticating juicers are best at juicing softer fruits like berries and wheatgrass and excel at juicing leafy greens, but can also juice harder fruits and vegetables like apples and carrots. Because the Juice Fountain Crush juices slowly, it keeps more of the fiber and less of the froth in the juice and produces very dry pulp. Juicing made simple The Juice Fountain Crush makes juicing and cleanup easy. With features like a safe start system that requires all parts to be locked in before the juicer starts, reverse direction control, and an overload protection system that automatically stops the machine from operating when the load is too high, the Juice Fountain Crush makes operation safe and easy. To cleanup and flush out the system between making different kinds of juice without having to disassemble the entire machine, simply pour in 1-2 cups of water while the motor is running to flush the previous ingredients through. It comes with a cleaning brush to remove the pulp from the mesh basket, and the handle of the brush is the perfect size to clear out the pulp chute of the juicer. And, even though it\u2019s powerful, the Juice Fountain Crush\u2019s 240 watt motor runs quietly so your morning glass of juice won\u2019t wake the rest of the household. Designed with the consumer in mind The upright design gives the Juice Fountain Crush a smaller footprint than horizontal masticating juicers, making it easier to fit on your counters. It includes a juicing jug for catching the juice that\u2019s extracted, a pulp bin for the pulp, and also includes a filter cleaning brush, which can be used for brushing out the filter or (using the smaller end of the brush) cleaning the pulp out of any crevasses.

Get relief from Cold and Flu Symptoms and bring Wellness to your entire Family with a Crane Adorable Humidifier. Featuring an award winning, child friendly animal designs and top rated performance, Crane\u2019s Adorable Ultrasonic Cool Mist Humidifiers provide up to 24 hours of soothing moisture to help relieve the effects of dryness and congestion, helping you and your Family to breathe easy and sleep through the night peacefully. The moisture that humidifiers add to dry air also help alleviate many common nuisances brought on by winter heating such as static electricity, peeling wallpaper, shrinking wood, and cracks in paint and furniture. All Natural, Non Medicated Relief from Dryness, Cough, Cold, and Flu Symptoms. Humidifiers are an ideal choice for relieving the discomforts of nasal congestion, dry itchy skin and hair, chapped lips, nose bleeds, and dry throats. Recent studies by the Center for Disease Control have also shown that relative humidity levels between 43% and 60% helps prevent the movement of germs, including the flu virus. An Adorable Baby Essential is the Perfect Baby Shower Gift! Humidifiers are especially important for Newborns because they are Obligate Nasal Breathers, breathing only through their tiny noses for their first 4 - 6 months. Any congestion can make breathing, feeding, and sleeping incredibly difficult for your little one. Not only that, but many pediatricians recommend the use of a humidifier as a safe, non medicated, all natural alternative to help relieve congestion from the common cold and flu instead of potentially harmful over-the-counter cough and cold medicine. Straightforward, Whisper-Quiet Operation With Clean Control Technology Crane's cheerful designs complement any children's bedroom decor. Not only are Crane humidifiers adorable, but they are easy to use, whisper quiet, and feature Antimicrobial Material in the Base to help reduce mold and bacteria growth by up to 99.96%*.

They\u2019re restored to a fully functional condition. In short, they are everything a Dyson machine should be - they work properly and don\u2019t lose suction. Dyson refurbishes vacuums that are returned to us by retailers or consumers. Refurbishing these machines, rather than disposing of them, means that the parts and materials are re-used instead of wasted. When a machine comes to us to be refurbished, it is first stripped down as far as necessary. Components removed from the machine that meet our high standards of quality are kept and cleaned. Most damaged or broken components are sent away for recycling. The core of the machine is thoroughly cleaned and new parts are added to replace damaged or cosmetically unacceptable parts discovered during the stripping down process. Just like our brand new machines, the rebuilt machine then undergoes a comprehensive series of electrical and performance tests to ensure that it works as it should. For our vacuums, one of the tests carried out is a suction test. All refurbished vacuums are electrically tested in compliance with electrical and safety requirements. One of the primary differences between a new Dyson machine and a refurbished Dyson machine is its appearance \u2013 a scratch here or there, or a slightly clouded bin may provide a clue that it has been previously used. After it has passed all of the tests, the machine is then packaged and sent out. All Dyson refurbished vacuums come with a 6-month parts and labor warranty.  The Dyson DC25 Animal Reconditioned is designed for homes with pets. It can be used on all floor types--carpet, wood, laminate, tile--and features Dyson\u2019s patented Root Cyclone technology, that doesn\u2019t lose suction power as you vacuum. DC25 Animal Reconditioned also features Ball technology, which allows you to smoothly steer the vacuum with a turn of the wrist. Because the motor is inside the ball, it has a low center of gravity making it even easier to steer and turn corners. The quick-draw telescope reach wand of the DC25 allows up to 16ft of reach for stair and high reach cleaning. The Clear bin made of tough polycarbonate lets you see when it needs emptying. Other on-board accessory tools include a combination accessory tool and a stair tool. DC25 Animal Reconditioned comes complete with a 6-month warranty, parts and labor guaranteed by Dyson. As with all Dyson vacuum cleaners, DC25 Animal has no loss of suction.  Root Cyclone technology - patented technology that doesn\u2019t lose suction power as you vacuum.Ball technology - steers smoothly with a turn of the wrist. Mini turbine head attachment - removes pet hair and dirt from hard to reach places such as upholstery, stairs and the car. Quickly attaches to the hose or wand.Motorized brush bar - independent motor drives the brush bar for better cleaning performance. Low center of gravity - the motor is inside the ball, giving the machine a low center of gravity making it even easier to steer. Quick-draw Telescope Reach wand - single-action wand with instant 16ft reach for stair and high-reach cleaning. Fingertip brush control - turn brush bar on and off at the touch of a button.

Skip the stovetop with combination cooking -- brown your ingredients in the unit and then simply switch to the slow cook function. Use the Cook Central to prep any aspect of your favorite dish. Select the steam function to prepare stuffed artichokes to start a gourmet meal or to create a healthful vegetable medley side dish. The Cook Central can even do dessert.

Clean-up is a breeze with the Cook Central as the pot, steaming rack and glass lid are dishwasher-safe.   Multi-Functional The first step to creating your meal with the Cook Central is selecting the cooking function.  Slow Cook Slow cooking is perfect for foods that require long, slow simmering, such as soups, stocks, stews, and dried beans. This function is also ideal when cooking tougher and less expensive cuts of meat like shoulder and pot roast. The Slow Cook function has three temperature settings -- High, Low, and Simmer. For recipes that need to cook longer, use the Simmer and Low settings. When starting a dish later in the day, select the High setting.

The roots of the company can be found in Oates' entrepreneurial spirit. He and his brother used to farm the mountain areas of Bat Cave in western North Carolina. They would also help their mother find materials for her crafts. The sons began to make wooden whistles, buckets and bird-houses. They would sell their wares along with her crafts to the people from Charlotte that came through in their horse-drawn buggies on the way to the mountains. Later, Thomas worked at the Ashville Postcard Company. When the Depression hit, he lost his job, but it inspired him to go into business and sell crafts, like cornhusk dolls and woven pieces, that were produced by the local women. He had learned about the wholesale business while working at Ashville. He built a waterwheel to generate electricity at a mill, began making product and opened shop. Over the years, he expanded the company. His son, Lemuel Oates, who would next manage the company, says he worked in the business from a young age. He explains the products were made from cotton scraps left over from making socks. Half-inch circles would be looped together to form a variety of products. Lemuel Oates went to college and then settled in Richmond. In December 1973, he returned to Bat Cave and took over the company.
