Get relief from Cold and Flu Symptoms and bring Wellness to your entire Family with a Crane Adorable Humidifier. Featuring an award winning, child friendly animal designs and top rated performance, Crane\u2019s Adorable Ultrasonic Cool Mist Humidifiers provide up to 24 hours of soothing moisture to help relieve the effects of dryness and congestion, helping you and your Family to breathe easy and sleep through the night peacefully. The moisture that humidifiers add to dry air also help alleviate many common nuisances brought on by winter heating such as static electricity, peeling wallpaper, shrinking wood, and cracks in paint and furniture. All Natural, Non Medicated Relief from Dryness, Cough, Cold, and Flu Symptoms. Humidifiers are an ideal choice for relieving the discomforts of nasal congestion, dry itchy skin and hair, chapped lips, nose bleeds, and dry throats. Recent studies by the Center for Disease Control have also shown that relative humidity levels between 43% and 60% helps prevent the movement of germs, including the flu virus. An Adorable Baby Essential is the Perfect Baby Shower Gift! Humidifiers are especially important for Newborns because they are Obligate Nasal Breathers, breathing only through their tiny noses for their first 4 - 6 months. Any congestion can make breathing, feeding, and sleeping incredibly difficult for your little one. Not only that, but many pediatricians recommend the use of a humidifier as a safe, non medicated, all natural alternative to help relieve congestion from the common cold and flu instead of potentially harmful over-the-counter cough and cold medicine. Straightforward, Whisper-Quiet Operation With Clean Control Technology Crane's cheerful designs complement any children's bedroom decor. Not only are Crane humidifiers adorable, but they are easy to use, whisper quiet, and feature Antimicrobial Material in the Base to help reduce mold and bacteria growth by up to 99.96%*. This compact, BPA Free unit uses ultrasonic technology to add humidity to the air, is more efficient than a household light bulb, and includes a built-in auto-shut-off feature that engages when the water tank is empty to ensure safety. 1 Year Manufacturer\u2019s Warranty Bonus 1 Year Parents Magazine Subscription Coupon Free one-year (12 issues) subscription coupon to Parents Magazine included in packaging.", "salesrank_2018": "153907"}, "B002LAS5R2": {"description": "Born from our passion for cooking and concern for the planet, the Ecolution line of cookware offers a full range of kitchen tools.

Use filtered water in your iron to reduce mineral build-up. Treat your pets to cleaner, filtered water. Cleaner, filtered water makes tea and instant soup or coffee taste better.  Parts & Features     12 Week Filter Timer: Lets you know when to change your water filter located on the top of the unit. Each filter will last for 3 months/or up to 48 gallons. NOTE: For optimum filtering and flow rates, the water filter must be prepared and installed in the easy steps exactly as outlined in the instruction manual. In 12 weeks, the word REPLACE will appear to remind you to replace the filter. Once the filter (Cuisinart model GF-80) is replaced, reset the timer by pressing the Start button for 3 seconds. The long life filter reduces chlorine taste and color, mercury, benzene, lead, and more. Upper Water Tank with Cover/Lower Tank: Upper tank holds approximately 1/2 gallon of unfiltered water with a flip top lid for easy filling plus the lower tank holds approximately 1 gallon of filtered water. After following the operating instructions and set up is complete your unit is ready to use and on subsequent fill ups, the unit should take less than 10 minutes to heat and 30 minutes to chill. Internal Water Tanks: Hot and cold tank hold approximately 1/2 gallon in total capacity. On/Off Power Button: Press to power On. This will activate the chilling and heating functions. Indicator Lights: Red/Blue LEDs light up when water has reached hot/cold temperatures. Green LED lights up when units is in \"Energy Saver\" mode (hot water is off). Energy Saver Switch: Turn off your heater when hot water is not needed to reduce the system's energy usage by more than 50%. While in the energy saving mode, you can still dispense water from your hot tank; however, it will not be heated. Simply place the Energy Saver switch in its On position. The green LED will light up, indicating your unit is in Energy Saver mode. Because your unit is in Energy Saver mode and your hot water heater is disabled, the red LED hot water indicator light will turn off when the temperature of the hot water decreases (this can take up to 2 hours). To resume your hot water, simply put the Energy Saver switch in its Off position. After about 15 minutes, the LED hot water indicator will light up, signaling hot water is ready to dispense. Note: If your unit has been in Energy Saver mode for longer than a week, we recommend you flush out your hot water tank by dispensing and disposing of a full glass of water from the left spigot before enjoying your first glass of hot water. Note: We recommend you power your unit off when only room temperature filtered water is needed. Drainage Plugs: Two removable plastic plugs are located on the bottom of the unit.    Standard Cleaning  Turn the unit off and unplug it from the outlet. Remove the filter and place it in a bowl. Lift upper water tank, let it drain into lower tank, and set it aside. Then lift lower tank off base and empty. Careful, a full tank can be very heavy. Clean the water tanks and cover with warm soapy water. NOTE: Remove filter timer before washing lid. Filter timer is not immersible. The base is not immersible. Simply wipe it clean with a damp cloth. Dry thoroughly when clean.   Semi-Annual Cleaning We recommend you clean your unit twice a year to boost its operation and performance and to remove any calcium scale residue from the heating and cooling elements.

The hot-forging process forms a strong bond between the pan and its nonstick coating, creating a pan that will stand up to years of use.  Hot-forging manufacturing process ensures pans will never warpAn induction compatible, magnetic stainless steel base ensures superior performance on any cooktopPans are oven-safe up to 500 degrees F (tempered glass lids are oven-safe up to 425 degrees F)Hollow, stay-cool cast stainless steel handles minimize heat transfer and fit comfortably in handSide handles and assist handles feature stainless steel rivets for durabilityNonstick coating is reinforced and safe for dishwashersA convenient side handle hole allows for hanging storage  Each Forged Hard-Anodized (FHA) pan is made from a heavy-gauge forged aluminum with a strong, durable finish that will withstand the demands of everyday use. Each pan absorbs and distributes heat evenly and efficiently, so there are no hot-spots during cooking. The specially-constructed base incorporates a magnetic stainless steel disk that gives extra strength and stability to the pan. Le Creuset FHA is completely multi-functional. Use it with any stovetop or under any broiler, or use in any conventional, induction or fan-assisted oven. As with any metal product, this material is not suitable for use in microwave ovens. Le Creuset's manufacturing process and the pan's internally reinforced nonstick surface combine to create a uniquely durable finish for extra strength and superb cooking results. Heat recommendations Use medium and low heat settings for the majority of cooking on all heat sources, and allow the pan to heat gradually and evenly. When searing meat, poultry or fish, a medium high heat can be used initially, but once the pan is hot and the food added, the heat should be lowered. The pan should never be used on the highest heat setting for either preheating or cooking. Excessive surface temperatures will damage the nonstick cooking surface. See section on details of misuse. Always use a stovetop burner that is similar in size to the base of the pan. Gas flames must always be confined to the base area and never extend up the sidewalls of the pan. On any glass-topped stove always lift the pan to move it. Never slide the pan, as this may cause damage to the stovetop or the base of the pan. The maximum safe temperature for oven use is 500 degrees F / 260 degrees C. When used under a hot broiler there should be a minimum distance of two inches (5cm) between the heat source and the top rim of the pan. Cleaning and care Cool the pan for a few minutes before cleaning. Do not plunge a hot pan into cold water. Only recommended nonstick cleaning pads should be used on the nonstick surfaces. Do not use any metal or abrasive pads or abrasive cleaning agents on any of the surfaces. The pan is dishwasher-safe, but washing by hand is recommended. Simply wash with hot, soapy water, and rinse and dry thoroughly. If the pan is regularly washed in the dishwasher some darkening of the rivets and outer ring of the base may occur, or a powdery white deposit may form. This is normal and will not affect the performance of the pan. The surface dulling or white deposits can be removed by carefully cleaning the affected areas with a gentle nylon pad and detergent. After cleaning, rinse and dry thoroughly. Each time the pan is cleaned in the dishwasher, the cooking surface should be re-conditioned with vegetable or corn oil before the next use. Le Creuset Heat-Resistant Glass Lids Add another dimension to cooking with a Le Creuset Forged Hard-Anodized pan by using a Le Creuset heat-resistant glass lid. The tempered glass lid allows you to check the recipe without disturbing the cooking progress or temperature. It retains moisture and flavor and converts the pan to one for poaching, braising or casseroling. The lids are oven-safe up to 325 degrees F.

Ideal for anyone who wants to personalize their juice drink recipes, rely on convenience for a busy schedule or help kick-start a healthy routine, the Big Mouth Juice Extractor is well worth the investment.  Part of a Healthy Lifestyle Did you know that eating fruits and vegetables are an important part of a healthy lifestyle? According to studies by the USDA, eating more fruits and vegetables reduces your risk of chronic diseases like heart attacks and strokes, some cancers, heart disease, obesity, and type 2 diabetes, in addition to acute ailments like kidney stones and high blood pressure. A glass of fresh, natural juice is an excellent, healthy way to begin your day or inject some serious energy into a lazy afternoon.

Designed and engineered for health-conscious people who want greater variety in their juicing routine, it can turn your whole fruits and vegetables into smooth juice form, while still keeping in all the nutrient-rich flavors your body needs.

Try out one of these healthy, delicious recipes to taste the difference in freshness:  THE GO-GETTER 4 medium kale leaves2 medium carrots, trimmed1 cup baby spinach leaves1 Granny Smith apple, quartered1/2 lemon, peeled1-inch piece fresh ginger, peeled Juice all ingredients in order listed.

Makes 2 servings  SPICY VEGGIE DELIGHT 2 broccoli flowerets with stalk1/4 green pepper1 carrot1 celery stalk 1 tomatoHot pepper sauce to taste Juice all ingredients in order listed. Stir well and serve. Makes 1 serving  Alternative Uses  Not sure what to do with the leftover pulp? The leftover pulp is mostly fiber and cellulose, which like the juice, contains necessary vital nutrients for the daily diet. Any leftover pulp can be used in a variety of recipes, frothy drinks, casseroles or soups, as well as for garden composting.  Thirsty for something other than juice? The Big Mouth Juice Extractor can help children, teens and adults get their daily vitamin intake with the option of making soy, almond or rice milk. To start, soak one cup of soybeans, almonds or rice in four cups of water for 24 to 48 hours in the refrigerator, and then slowly pour one cup into the food chute. The liquid extracted from the soaked mixture is \"milk.\" For enhanced milk flavor, consider adding vanilla or honey.  Easy Cleaning, More Enjoying Ease of cleaning is particularly important, because as with any small kitchen appliance, you will naturally use it more frequently if you can anticipate a hassle-free cleanup. With the Big Mouth Juice Extractor, it's easy to assemble and disassemble when preparing to juice or putting away. All parts \u2013 except for the motor base \u2013 are dishwasher safe. Here are some more easy-to-follow tips for effortless cleanup:  Place a plastic grocery bag in the pulp bin container to collect the pulp and once juicing is complete, simply discard. When you're done juicing, pass the strainer basket under running water and brush off excess fiber buildup or pulp with included cleaning brush.  TIPS & CARE  Some extractors yield more juice than others, and the proportion of pulp to juice varies from fruit to fruit. Most fruits and vegetables such as apples, carrots and cucumbers will not need to be pre-cut into smaller pieces since they are likely to fit into the extra-wide feed chute. However, it is recommended that oranges, pineapples, melons and mangoes be peeled before placing in the unit to minimize impact on juice flavor. Also, all fruits with pits and large seeds, such as nectarines, peaches, apricots, plums and cherries MUST be pitted before juicing. To extract the maximum amount of juice every time, gently guide food down the feed chute slowly so that juice doesn't spray out of the spout. Do not allow pulp container to overfill, as this may prevent correct operation or damage to the unit.

In addition, building on the success of its cutlery business, Victorinox has brought all the same quality and expertise to a wider range of products and accessories, including other kitchen tools, pocket tools, watches, luggage, and clothing. Who is R.H. Forschner? Victorinox had been a staple in European commercial cutlery for over 50 years when approached by New York's R.H. Forschner, known since 1855 as a builder of scales for butchers, to be their sole cutlery supplier. The two companies joined forces in 1937, and R.H. Forschner subsequently became North America's dominant professional brand, as ubiquitous in the bustling meatpacking plants of the Midwest as it is in the gleaming, four-star restaurant kitchens of Midtown Manhattan. As a division of Victorinox/Swiss Army Brands, R.H. Forschner marketed cutlery under the brand name \"RH Forschner by Victorinox\" and distributed to the commercial, food service, and retail trade classes. That brand has been considered a top choice of professionals worldwide with over 300 styles of blades bearing the R.H. Forschner name. However, in 2009, in conjunction with Victorinox's 125th anniversary, the company, Victorinox Swiss Army, Inc., has decided to remove the \"RH Forschner\" name from all blades. Blades thenceforth only include the \"Victorinox\" name. What is a stamped blade? A stamped knife can usually be identified by the absence of a bolster. Stamped blades are cut into their shapes from cold-rolled pieces of steel and then ground, tempered, and sharpened. Creating them requires many less steps than forging and results in lighter, narrower blades. Some professionals prefer the thicker, heavier forged blades, but many pros, who spend much of their day cutting and slicing, enjoy a lighter knife since it's less fatiguing and easier to manipulate at speed. Stamped knives are easier to produce and therefore less expensive. They perform very well and can approach the quality of a forged blade, but not the weight or feel. Victorinox manufactures a complete range of stamped blades with unique, patented Fibrox handles and they are considered among the greatest values in the knife industry. What knives do I need to own? Knife choice or selection is determined by many factors--size, function, style, and preference. The most important factor is function. Different knives have different uses. It is important to use the proper knife for a specific task, since proper knife selection and the use of a proper-sized, sharp knife make for safe cutting. General kitchen tasks and the knife to use for them are as follows:  Paring: The most common to own and use, a paring knife is generally for small cutting jobs and peeling of vegetables or fruit. The blade size is usually from three to four inches. Choose the shape and size to fit your hand. Since this is one of the more versatile knives, owning more than one is recommended.  Chef's: The most important tool and essential to every cook, a chef's knife is most often used in a rocking method to mince, dice, and chop vegetables and herbs. This one is known as the chef's best friend.  Slicer: Most commonly used to slice meats, poultry, and seafood, the slicer is an important companion to any host or hostess.  Boning: As its name suggests, a boning knife is used to trim or remove meat and fish from the bone.  Bread: Designed with a special edge, a bread knife makes easy work of cutting through crusty bread, pastries, or any item with a crust and a soft interior.  Fillet: Most often used by pros and seasoned home chefs, the fillet knife is used to fillet meat and fish.  Cleaver: An important addition to any collection, a cleaver is often used to cut or chop through bones.  Santoku: This knife combines the features of a cleaver with a chef's knife. The curved blade helps the rocking motion used for chopping, and the wide blade works well for scooping sliced food off a cutting board and for crushing garlic. The santoku can also be used to slice meat and has a narrow spine for making thin cuts.  Utility: An all-purpose knife often referred to as a sandwich knife, the utility knife peels and slices fruits and vegetables, and even carves small meats.  Shaping: With its curved blade, a shaping knife is great for small precision cuts where control is essential, such as peeling, trimming, or garnishing.   What are the different knife edges and what do they do?  Straight: The vast majority of Victorinox knives come with a straight or fine edge. This means it has a perfect taper along the blade and no serrations. It is designed to cut without tearing or shredding.  Serrated: An edge designed with small, jagged teeth along the edge.  Scalloped: A blade with waves along the edge generally used to cut breads with a hard crust and soft interior, as well as tougher-skinned fruits and vegetables.  Granton: This edge has hollowed-out grooves or dimples on the sides of the blade. These grooves fill with the fat and juices of the product being cut, allowing for thin, even cuts without tearing. Even with the grooves, these are still straight-edge knives and can be honed with a sharpening steel.   How should I care for my cutlery? After use, knives should not be allowed to soak in water. The best practice is to hand wash and dry them immediately. This is especially true if they have been used on fruit or salty foods, which may cause some staining, even on stainless steel. Most knives require very little maintenance and it is worth the effort to protect your investment. Though Victorinox knives are dishwasher safe, this is strongly discouraged. The dishwasher's agitation may cause damage. Additionally, harsh detergents can be harmful and cause pitting and spotting on the blades. The handles may also discolor and develop a white film with constant use of the dishwasher. Plus, intense heat associated with dishwashers is not good for the temper of the blade. How do I keep my knives sharp? All quality knives require proper maintenance to keep them in perfect cutting shape. The best of edges will quickly dull if it strikes metal, glass, or Formica. A wooden cutting board makes the best cutting surface. And, if a slip occurs, a proper cutting board is safer for the user. Frequent use of a Victorinox sharpening steel will keep blades in tip top working condition. All straight-edge knives need steeling to keep their edges. How to \"Steel\" a Knife  Steeling a Knife   Hold the steel firmly in your left hand with the guard positioned to stop the blade should it slip. Hold the knife in your right hand and place on top part of steel as shown. Raise back of blade one-eighth inch. Now, moving the blade only, draw it across the steel in an arching curve, pivoted at your wrist. The blade tip should leave the steel about two-thirds of the way down. Repeat the same action with the Blade on the bottom side of the steel. Always maintain the same pressure and angle on both sides of the steel. Repeat five or six times.   How should I store my knives? Safety is the biggest concern of storage, both to the user and to protect the knife's edge. Choices include a knife magnet, knife block, drawer insets, and also individual knife protectors.  Note: Word \"Fibrox\u201d is NOT a signature, it may or may not be present due to the variations in the molds we use for the handles.

The top and sides of the bed are constructed with a special network of interconnected air cells that cause the air to flow smoothly and gradually across the sleeping surface. The unique engineering creates a luxurious sleeping surface that's comfortable and stable--a dramatic departure from many other inflatable beds. The mattress is also equipped with a quality-tested, 20.8-gauge waterproof flocked top with 15-gauge vinyl beams and 16-gauge sides and bottom for stability. And best of all, the Supreme Air-Flow mattress is remarkably easy to inflate thanks to the built-in, high-powered electric pump, which does its job in a mere 3-1/2 minutes. No more fussing with tiring hand or foot pumps or rummaging through the garage for your detached electric pump. And should the mattress feel a little too soft or firm, you can customize the comfort level with the touch of a button. The Supreme Air-Flow is raised 20 inches from the floor, making it far taller than most inflatable mattresses. And at 39 by 20 by 75 inches (W x H x D), the mattress is an official Twin size, making it a good fit for fitted sheets. The Supreme Air-Flow Twin bed--which offers a capacity of 300 pounds--is a terrific choice whether you're sleeping at the in-law's overcrowded house or setting up a guest bed in the basement. The mattress comes with an AC power cord and a duffel bag (for storage). Regarding Inflation: Measurements will vary based on the manner in which it is inflated and packaging disclaims \u201capproximate size\u201d.

Also like you, we don't want to pay too much for what we buy. Saber Knives was started because of our frustration at the high cost of quality cutlery. Convinced a small, well-managed company could engineer and produce a product equal to the very best German knives, we set out to do just that. No effort has been spared to reach that goal. We only make fully-forged knives using the best steel, as it makes for a better knife. If you want to pay too much for quality knives, that's your business. If you want to buy a premium set of knives and have money left over-that's our business. When we were first planning the production of Saber Knives, we had our mission to \"create the highest caliber of cutlery at an affordable price point\" in mind. From the get go, we shared some of the concerns our customers have expressed about manufacturing in China. However, after much time and research into manufacturing options, we found that by making Saber Knives in China we could provide a hot-drop forged and ice treated knife of exceptional quality at a reasonable price while ensuring the environmental and fair labor standards we require. Overseas, at our manufacturing facilities in China, we have inspectors on the ground every day. They are in communication with factory managers and workers to ensure implementation of quality control, fair labor, and environmental standards and policies. In addition, we require third-party social audits of our manufacturing facilities. A Code of Conduct is in place for the factory which includes guidelines covering ethical standards, employee rights, fair labor standards, professional management systems, manufacturing excellence, and health and safety of workers, employees and end users. In addition to rigorous oversight of our entire production process, we have stringent controls to ensure the quality and safety of our finished products including regular product testing through third-party, accredited laboratories to meet regulatory requirements and our own high standards for product safety. By keeping our company small we can ensure a price point for our world-class knives that under-cuts the competition by as much as 70%! Our commitment to responsible manufacturing, packaging and shipping is part of a much larger and more comprehensive commitment to offer the best possible knife quality at prices most can afford. Saber knives offer a unique high-quality solution for the hard-working chef! We specialize in custom manufacturing of high grade knives for the culinary artist. Each knife is hot drop forged from a single piece of proprietary German steel. German Metallurgical Engineers pioneered the high carbon stainless steel manufacturing process. This process produces a metal that is hard enough to hold an edge, flexible enough not to break, and soft enough to hone and sharpen. It also must have all of the right qualities to resist rust and corrosion throughout its lifetime. The resulting formula for German stainless steel is: X 45 Cr Mo V 15. This recipe for metal is what is used to ensure every Saber knife is chef sharp!     The Saber Knives Working Professional Chef Knife is intended to provide the career oriented chef with all of the tools necessary to create magic in the kitchen. The Saber Chef Bag embodies the quality and craftsmanship that we put into our products. Each individual knife is contained in industrial grade polyurethane sheaths, held in place by concealed magnetic that are strong enough to keep your knives from moving around in transit. Every detail was tended to ensuring durability and logevity - a rarity for knife bags! To further ease transport every chef bag uses an industrial grade zipper, and a padded carrying strap.

Grind and BrewFeature and Benefits  The CoffeeTEAM TS features a stainless steel thermal carafe to keep your coffee perfectly hot for hours, without reheating. Stainless steel accents throughout the machine make this the most sophisticated Coffee Maker / Burr Grinder combination on the market. The innovative direct-feed technology allows the coffee filter holder to stay inside the machine during the grinding. As a result, aroma is maximized and mechanical movements within the machine are reduced. The compact footprint is a function of direct-feed technology and smart design; the carafe and GoldTone filter are placed under the control panel, and the 6-ounce bean container is tucked into the top back corner. Only the CoffeeTEAM TS lets you program the amount of coffee you want to grind: choose from 4, 6, 8 or 10 cups and select mild, regular or strong. You can even program two completely different settings, one for manual operation and one for automatic operation. This way you always enjoy exactly the same coffee taste. The CoffeeTEAM TS uses solid steel conical burrs. The slow grinding of the burrs imparts minimal heat preserving more aroma than blade grinding. It also allows a finer and more uniform grind than combination machines with a blade grinder. Five fineness settings for light to dark beans let you adjust the grinder to your preferred beans (the darker/oilier the bean, the coarser the setting).

You can also use your Greenstar Elite Juice Extractor to make other delicious foods with the included homogenizing accessories, such as baby foods, breadsticks, nut butters, p\u00e2t\u00e9s, frozen fruit sorbets, and much more! The Greenstar Elite Slow Juicer unleashes the very best nutrition that nature has to offer, utilizing advanced bio-ceramic, magnetic Jumbo Twin Gears to get the most nutrients and juice-yield from your produce. The unique shape and properties of Greenstar Elite\u2019s Jumbo Twin Gears extracts more juice and performs better than other Twin Gear, centrifugal, or cold press juicers.  The Greenstar Elite Cold-Press Complete Masticating Slow Juicer is the best twin-gear juice extractor for maximizing the nutritional value and yield from all your fruits, vegetables, and greens. Unlike centrifugal juicers that oxidize your juice during extraction, the Greenstar Elite is a slow, cold-press juicer that works at 110 RPM, preserving the quality of your produce so you can enjoy all the healthy benefits of juicing. The unique Twin Gears are made of stainless-steel and stain-resistant nylon for durability and easy cleaning. They are specially patented with bio-ceramic magnetic technology not found in other twin gear or single auger juicers that create a magnetic field as you juice, so your juice is more easily absorbed into your body and stays fresher for longer: up to 72 hours! And while other juicers claim to be masticating juicers, the Greenstar Elite Juicer truly is a complete mastication juice extractor: just as we have three different types of teeth that perform 3 different functions that begin the digestive process, the Greenstar Pro twin gears have 3 stages of mastication, making this juicer a Complete Masticating Juicer. The Greenstar Pro Complete Masticating Juicer is also U.S. commercial-certified for use in commercial kitchens, juice bars, and cafes, so you know it is durable and powerful enough to keep up with your healthy lifestyle needs.  EXCLUSIVE BIO-CERAMIC AND MAGNETIC TECHNOLOGY \u2013 At the core of each twin gear are bio-ceramic, magnetic materials found only in the Tribest Greenstar brand of cold press, complete masticating juicers that extracts exceptional quality, nutrient-dense juices. As the gears turn during juicing, they generate a magnetic field that helps to stabilize the sensitive enzymes and vitamins in living plant cells so your juice tastes better and lasts longer \u2013 even up to 72 hours! In contrast, juices made from centrifugal juicers can be stored for only a couple of hours and if made from single auger juicers, storage is possible only for a maximum of 48 hours. This innovative technology also restructures larger water clusters to smaller ones so your body can absorb all the fresh juice quickly.  ADVANCED COMPLETE MASTICATING TWIN GEAR DESIGN - While many juicers claim to be masticating, the Greenstar Pro Slow Juicer is the only truly complete mastication juicer with its specially designed three-stage all stainless-steel twin gears. Just as there are three stages of mastication \u2013 slicing, cutting, and triturating \u2013 at a rate of about 100-120 chews per minute, the twin gears rotate at 110 RPM and has 3 specially design features \u2013 pocket recesses for slicing, cutting points to break down long stringy greens and vegetables like celery and kale, and a trituration-mixing stage at the end of each gear. This complete masticating design mimics the way nature intended our foods to be broken down at the beginning of the digestive process, so even though it is difficult to try and literally eat pounds of fruits, vegetables, and greens in one sitting, you can still reap the benefits of drinking their nutrient-concentrated juices.  OUTLET PRESSURE ADJUSTING KNOB FOR CUSTOMIZED JUICE EXTRACTION \u2013 Juicing a whole range of fruits, vegetables, greens, and roots is easier than ever with the Greenstar Pro Cold Press Juicer outlet pressure adjusting knob. Simply turn the knob in all the way for greater pressure in the twin gear area, for harder, more fibrous produce or loosen the knob for softer, high-water content fruits.  LOW SPEED, HIGH-QUALITY, HIGH-YIELD JUICE EXTRACTION \u2013 The slow juicing speed of the Greenstar Pro Juice Extractor makes juices taste better and stay fresh for up to 72 hours with high nutrient retention.Unlike high-speed, centrifugal juicers that spin at thousands of RPM which oxidize the juice even before you can drink it, the Greenstar Pro slowly presses and squeezes the juice from your produce so you can enjoy all the nutrients they have to offer. The slow juicing method with specifically a twin-gear juicer like the Greenstar Pro increases your juice yield by about 30-50%, decreasing food waste and saving money. The low RPM has the added benefit of operating quietly, so you can enjoy your juice any time of day or night.  INCREASED VERSATILITY WITH THE INCLUDED HOMOGENIZING ACCESSORIES \u2013 The Greenstar Pro Juice Extractor is much more than just a juicer; with the included accessories, it is also a food processor and homogenizer. Maximize your daily intake of fresh greens, fruits, and veggies by using the Greenstar Pro to make frozen fruit sorbets, fresh salsas, healthy sauces, and homemade nut butters. The homogenizing accessories add more value to your investment and increase the ways you can use the Greenstar Pro Juicer in your kitchen.  BPA-FREE, STAIN-RESISTANT PARTS \u2013 All the parts of the Greenstar Pro Cold Press Juicer are made of high quality, BPA-free plastics that are stronger and more stain-resistance that parts found in cheaper juicers, with the exception of the twin gears which are completely stainless-steel. Rest easy knowing that your juice is free from harmful BPA chemicals found in lesser quality plastics, and save time cleaning the stain-resistant parts when juicing colorful vegetables and greens.  INDUSTRY LEADING 15-YEAR HOUSEHOLD, 3 YEAR COMMERCIAL WARRANTY \u2013 The Greenstar Pro comes with a 15-year manufacturer\u2019s warranty for household use, and a 3-year warranty for professional use, with a dedicated Customer Service team at Tribest Corporation. The extended warranty period is a testament to the quality of the Greenstar Pro Juicer.

Adams: A 2nd-Generation, Family-Owned Company Kitchen storage solutions by J.K. Adams make it easy to save on valuable kitchen space while enjoying the best of USA-made craftsmanship. The family-owned company provides everything from pot hooks and spice bottles to wooden spice carousels, kitchen-knife blocks, bread boxes, wine racks, pot racks, and more. J.K. Adams' wooden kitchen items feature renewable and sustainable wood in Maple, Cherry, Walnut, Alder, Ash, or Hickory varieties. A thoughtful choice for gift giving, the high-quality kitchen items provide sleek designs and convenient functionality for year after year of everyday convenience. Innovative Kitchen-Storage Solutions In the late-1970's, when the gourmet-chef-tools market in the U.S. was still in its infancy, J.K. Adams owner Malcolm Cooper, Sr. conceived of the first slanted knife block. His goal was to create a cutlery organizer that would hold knives at a low enough angle that they could be easily removed from the block when it was pushed back under a cabinet overhang. The J.K. Adams Kangaroo knife block was launched in 1980--the first-ever slanted knife block, and still the best. Recognizing the many opportunities to improve kitchen storage, J.K. Adams introduced the revolving \"carousel\" spice rack in 1982 followed by countless other well-designed storage products in the years since, including the popular in-drawer knife tray in 1994, a space-saving alternative to the knife block that offers the same safety and blade protection. In 2011, J.K. Adams takes cutlery storage to a new level once again with the new Universal knife block. For over 30 years, J.K. Adams has continued to lead and inspire the kitchen storage market with their innovative designs, superior hardwoods, and exemplary craftsmanship.  Today, J.K. Adams continues to provide innovative designs, superior hardwoods, and high-quality craftsmanship. J.K. Adams: Over 65 Years of New England Yankee Craftsmanship          Some of the world's finest woodworkers can be found in New England. The rich heritage and folklore of the great Yankee Woodworker is as well known today as it was hundreds of years ago, and the craft has been handed down through the generations. J.K. Adams' success is certainly attributable to the early Vermonters employed by the company while in its infancy who brought forth the techniques and quality craftsmanship that could only come from generations of shared knowledge and experience. The J.K. Adams factory has been at the same location since the beginning. As many as three generations of families have relied on J.K. Adams to provide for their families. Located in a rural area of Vermont, J.K. Adams remains one of the largest employers in the area and is an important pillar of support for the local community. J.K. Adams has always used the creativity and skill of their workforce in developing new products, and today J.K. Adams continues its New England craftsmanship with a wide variety of cutting boards, as well as wooden salad bowls, kitchen islands, and slate serving trays. And at the J.K. Adams factory, you'll find future generations of woodworkers building upon the traditions begun over 65 years ago. Cutting boards and other products by J.K Adams are made in the North America.     About J.K. Adams' Logo In colonial New England, three strokes of a broad ax were used to mark the finest trees in the forest for the Queens' Navy shipmasts. The broad arrow was adopted as our logo because it symbolizes the exceptional quality of wood that goes into our products. J.K. Adams' Company History  Started over 65 years ago in a small garage in Dorset, Vermont Cooper family purchased business from founder Josiah K. Adams in 1949 Began with the Speedy Racer toy, and then followed by manufacturing drafting and surveying tables, Kiwi shoe groomers, gifts, and furniture Now the leading supplier of wooden storage and food preparation products for the specialty housewares industry   Our Wood  Maple, Cherry, Walnut, Alder, Ash, and Hickory Either from New England or other North American sources Renewable and sustainable Hard and durable, yet forgiving to knife edges  Wood Grains End Grain  Prized for look and longest wear Identifiable by small pieces put together Board usually thick and heavy Many pieces, lots of glue joints, cracking can be a problem  Edge Grain  Most common in cutting boards Moderate grain pattern Stable with minimum glue joints  Why Choose a Wood Cutting Board? Wood is naturally anti-bacterial, and any bacteria left on the board will actually lessen in time versus multiplying on a plastic cutting board. A wooden board will also be more gentle on your knife's edge, and it just feels and sounds better under a knife. Caring for Your J.K. Adams Cutting Board Wash by hand in warm soapy water and dry thoroughly, and oil frequently with mineral oil to help give it an optimal appearance. Do not soak, microwave, freeze, or put in the dishwasher. For removing stains, you can use a weak bleach-and-water solution or a combination of lemon juice and salt. Be sure to rinse and wipe with mineral oil afterward. Additionally, the surface can be sanded to make the board look like new--although a board with wear will add character to your kitchen. For storage, keep the board away from strong sunlight as avoiding UV rays will reduce the risk of fading.   Environmental Responsibilities  We only purchase lumber from a select few suppliers who we are confident practice sustainable forestry practices Vermont forests are growing faster than they are being harvested J.K.

The glass has been Thermal Shock tested so you can pull it out of a steamy dishwasher and safely make a frosty cold beverage right away.

The verdict? Fresh beans are always preferable.   Convenient hidden storage compartment for the filters and included cleaning kit. Fresh is Best In the world of coffee, freshness can be measured in seconds. By the time even five minutes has passed, ground beans have started to lose their flavor. Grinding beans every time you want fresh espresso takes time, though, and oftentimes it becomes a tradeoff between taste and convenience. The Breville Barista Express solves this problem, delivering fresh, quality espresso at remarkable speed, thanks to its integrated burr grinder. Go from beans to espresso in under a minute\u2014all in the comfort of your own home. Caf\u00e9 quality espresso in your home Espresso making is notorious for being both an art and a science, requiring you to carefully adjust each of the inputs (grind size, grind amount, etc.). But even complete beginners and aspiring baristas can pull a perfect shot from the Breville Barista Express. For beginners, it comes with two dual-wall, pressurized filters that regulate pressure and help optimize the extraction. For more experienced baristas, the Barista Express includes two single-wall, non-pressurized filters that give you more room to experiment with different grind sizes, grind amounts, and tamping pressure. As either a crash-course or a continuation study, the Barista Express gives you free rein to explore the art of espresso. In addition to its integrated burr grinder, the Breville Barista Express has an Italian-manufactured 15 bar pump and thermocoil heating system that ensures accurate regulation of water temperature for a full-flavored espresso. A pre-brew function and flat shower head make sure that the water is optimally distributed through the coffee puck. The Barista Express also has several helpful features, such as a cup warmer on the top of the machine and a feature that removes excess water from the filter basket after coffee extraction, so the used grounds form a dry puck for quicker cleanup. Lastly, it has a stainless steel 360 degree swivel-action steam wand for lattes and cappuccinos. For beginners and aspiring baristas alike, the Barista Express makes good espresso accessible and easy to make. Designed with the consumer in mind The Breville Barista Express is built from high-quality materials so the resulting machine is as sturdy as possible. No-slip feet keep the machine from sliding across the counter when the burr grinder is activated. The Barista Express is housed in a sleek stainless steel casing, making it an attractive and timeless addition to any kitchen. The entire unit is easy to clean and comes with a hideaway storage compartment for the included cleaning tools, in addition to an easily removable drip tray.    Hands-free filling for the portafilter directly from the integrated burr grinder   Included dual wall filters provide excellent practice for budding baristas Product Features   Integrated conical burr grinder and half-pound bean hopper: stainless steel conical burrs optimize extraction of flavor from the bean by maximizing the surface area of the grinds.

The four sides of the locking system promote an airtight seal due to equal pressure to all four sides, along with the hollow-center silicon sealing ring that makes it possible to lock tightly (the silicone sealing ring can be removed for cleaning if necessary).

Second, the Keurig's resusable K-Cup does not produce as good of a cup of coffee as the K-Cup itself. The designs are different and the water flows out the sides of the filter rather than down through the coffee. Third, the design is big, bulky, and hard to store. If you already have a turnstile for K-Cups, you can not store these there. With this product you can. \n\n The Cap allows you to recycle your K-Cups. Fill them with your favorite coffee or tea.

And with this SodaStream Genesis Starter Kit, you've got everything you need to turn tap water into sparkling water in 30 seconds--thus saving you money . This black/silver SodaStream Genesis soda maker comes with two BPA-free plastic 1-liter bottles and one CO2 cylinder that will make up to 60 liters of sparkling water. With no batteries or electricity, you can use your soda maker in your kitchen, outdoors on your patio or deck, or on your boat or R.V.          In addition to making fizzy water, SodaStream also offers more than 25 regular, diet, energy and caffeine-free flavors of syrup (sold separately). Each 500ml soda mix bottle makes the equivalent of 12 liters of soda (about 33 cans). And with over 25 flavors, the possibilities for creative beverages are limited only by your imagination. How about a Creamsicle (Orange and Cream Soda), or a Japanese Beetle (Ginger Ale and Lemon-Lime)? The regular soda mixes contain no high fructose corn syrup, while the diet soda mixes contain no aspartame.  The benefits of the SodaStream drinks maker, compared to ready made bottled drinks:  Provides an endless supply of sparkling water, freshly made from tap water in just a few seconds. No more need to buy, carry or store large quantities of heavy and bulky bottles. A wide variety of flavors are produced by SodaStream. The ability to make sparkling water as strong or as weak as one likes, makes the machine an ideal solution for the family's entire sparkling beverage needs.   The SodaStream Genesis Starter Kit bundles the soda maker with one 60L carbonator and two BPA-free carbonating bottles.  The Genesis soda maker carbonates water in a BPA-free, reusable one-liter bottle in less than 30 seconds, without electricity or batteries, and with no clean-up. After loading the carbonator into the soda-maker, fill the bottle with regular tap or filtered water and place it in the soda maker. Just pump the button a few times to add the fizz and in seconds you will have a liter of fresh, tasty soda or sparkling water in a resealable bottle that stores compactly in your fridge.  Each BPA-free carbonating bottle has a lifespan of 3 years and is not made with any polycarbonate materials or substances that produce phthalates or PCBs. Each bottle includes a special hermetic sealing cap that keeps drinks fresh and fizzy much longer than store-bought bottles. SodaStream bottles are specially designed for high-pressure resistance and are the only bottles that can be used with SodaStream soda makers.  When the CO2 carbonator is empty, you can visit the SodaStream web site to purchase a new CO2 cylinder as well as set up a cylinder exchange, which helps to eliminate waste. SodaStream collects your empty cylinder and returns it to our filling facility where it's cleaned, inspected and refilled.  The SodaStream Genesis measures 16.4 by 8 by 5.2 inches (HxWxD) and weighs 3.66 pounds.  How Does SodaStream Help the Environment? SodaStream is an \"Active Green\" company, meaning that consumers actively minimize their CO2 footprint when using the SodaStream system. The more the system is used on a daily basis, the more CO2 footprint the user actively saves. This differs from \"Passive Green\" brands, which use green-friendly production processes, but their products are not inherently helping you save on your daily footprint.  Because SodaStream uses water straight from the tap, the system makes traditional store-bought beverage bottles obsolete. That means, less plastic manufactured, less plastic waste and less transport of bottled beverages. Globally, 206 billion liters of bottled water were consumed in 2008 (Zenith International Global Bottled Water Report, 2008), and the energy required to make water bottles just in the US is equivalent to 17 million barrels of oil (Container Recycling Institute, 2002).  A family of four could slash their home soft-drink-related packaging usage by over 90 percent simply by using a SodaStream soda maker, and SodaStream's plastic carbonating bottles are reusable for up to three years. A typical American will toss away over 1500 aluminum cans (and/or hundreds of plastic 2-liter bottles) over three years, while a SodaStream owner will use just one or two reusable carbonating bottles or carafes that come with the home soda maker.  Operating without batteries or electricity, SodaStream home soda makers are highly energy-efficient small appliances. Appliances that work without electricity improve the environment by cutting down on the emissions generated by electrical plants, giving us cleaner air and ground water.  By operating completely on power supplied by the compressed air in the carbonator--an easily renewable fuel source--SodaStream does not contribute to environmental pollution made by batteries. Empty carbonators are returned to SodaStream to be cleaned, inspected and refilled with CO2 drawn naturally from the air. Carbonators are reusable as long as they remain in good condition. Frequently Asked Questions Can I carbonate drinks other than water? No. Only water should be carbonated in the SodaStream home soda maker. You risk damaging your soda maker, not to mention making a big fizzy mess. The money-back guarantee and the warranty are both invalidated if you carbonate any liquid other than water in your soda maker.  Why does the carbonating bottle have an expiration date? Since the bottle has to withstand recurring pressure from carbonation, it cannot be used forever. The expiration date on the bottle must be checked and new bottles purchased as soon as the former expires. The bottles must also be replaced if put in the dishwasher, exposed to a heat source, or if they have become scratched. All components of carbonating bottles are recyclable. Check with your local recycling authority for more information.  How do I clean my carbonating bottles? Carbonating bottles may be cleaned in warm water with a bottle brush and regular dish-washing liquid if necessary. Please do not place carbonating bottles in the dishwasher, as exposure to extreme heat can weaken the integrity of the bottles. Bottles stay cleanest when rinsed and then immediately filled with fresh water and returned to your refrigerator. Plus, you'll always have cold water on hand when you're ready for your next bottle of soda.  How long does the soda last before going flat? The hermetic seal on the cap keeps your soda from going flat as quickly as ordinary store-bought beverages. If you make sure to close the cap tightly, and keep the bottle in the refrigerator, your SodaStream soda should remain fizzy and fresh for over a week.  How often will I have to replace my carbonator? On average, the carbonator will make 60 liters of soda, and this number could be more or less depending on the amount of carbonation used when making your drink. A household of four soda drinkers might need to replace a 60-liter carbonator every 6-8 weeks, depending on usage.  Are SodaStream products kosher? SodaStream products are kosher (OU) certified (OU kosher certificate). SodaStream seltzer is kosher for Passover (OUP). Also, please note that your home drink smaker can be used on the Sabbath.", "salesrank_2018": "533035"}, "B002TWBSVW": {"description": "The Rubbermaid 1G1706WHT Evolution Small Sink Mat, White, is part of Rubbermaid's new line of sinkware products complete with Microban antimicrobial protection.

Bioelectrical Impedance (BI) is a well established and respected method used to estimate body fat and hydration. Muscles, blood vessels and bones are body tissues with a relative high water content which conducts electricity easily. Body fat is tissue that on the other hand displays much less electric conductivity. With BIA, the Ozeri Scale sends a weak and harmless electrical current through your body to determine the amount of fat tissue. This weak electrical current is imperceptible to the user, and returns back data that is used together with the user provided weight, height, age and gender to instantly calculate body fat and body water ratios. The Ozeri Gen II Digital MultiFunction Bathroom Scale displays results on an easy to read bright 3.5\u201d diagonal LCD screen. It also features built-in memory that can store up to 10 personal profiles each with individual measurements and monitoring so that your family members or friends at the gym can each track their progress.

Oysters knives are unique in the world of cutlery. To shuck an oyster a chef is presented with the task of \"splitting a rock\" first then proceeding to properly process the most tender of meats hidden within. In this endeavor no standard knife will do. The Victorinox New Haven Oyster Knife is an ideal design particularly when perfect oysters on the half shell are desired. The forward bulge in the handle serves as a stabilizing thumb rest while the more narrow body behind it enhances a good grip for the rest of the fingers. The rear of the handle is bulged again for good support in the base of the palm. The fairly short, carbon steel blade has rather dull edges, the underside is gently convex and the top side is flat. The blade is fairly wide and does not narrow much for about three-fourths of the way towards the top. In about the last fourth of the blade it narrows to a sharp point and the lower convex blade side starts to elegantly taper to the blade point from both sides. Unlike other oyster knife designs, the tip ends up sitting high in the place of the blade. This presents two advantages to an oyster lover. First, the tip design allows excellent leverage, second, the tip tends to travel high inside the oyster above and away from the tender meat. The New Haven Oyster Knife is the best choice for opening any small and medium sized oysters for half shell consumption.", "salesrank_2018": "12866"}, "B002UPTCS4": {"description": "Products offered by Catskill Craftsmen are made from naturally self-sustaining, non-endangered North American hardwoods, primarily birch and hard rock maple.

Convenient food-storage containers Airtight and watertight Made of high-quality BPA-free plastic Food-safe and hygienic 4-sided locking system with silicone seal Durable construction Stackable and nestable for space-saving storage Microwave- and dishwasher-safe Available in a variety of shapes and sizes    Lock&Lock Food-Storage Solutions Save Food, Save Money, Save Space A useful addition to any busy household, Lock&Lock's Classic plastic food-storage containers come in handy for storing fresh and frozen foods--from healthy snacks like cut-up fruits and vegetables to leftovers or dinners for the week. They also work well for keeping pasta, rice, flour, sugar, crackers, cookies, and other cupboard or pantry items fresh for longer, securely stored, and neatly organized. Even more, the versatile storage containers can be used to transport lunches to and from work or school--or even for storing smaller kitchen, office, or craft items. Lock&Lock's full line of Classic food-storage containers offers a wide range of shapes and sizes--each with a securely locking lid for airtight storage and peace of mind. Furthermore, the clear body of the containers makes identifying contents easy--no labels required.    Ideal for wet or dry food storage. Airtight Containers with Four-Sided Locking System    Lock&Lock's Classic food-storage containers feature an innovative four-sided locking system for an airtight seal and watertight storage so food stays fresh longer and there's no messy leaks or spills to worry about. The four sides of the locking system promote an airtight seal due to equal pressure to all four sides, along with the hollow-center silicon sealing ring that makes it possible to lock tightly (the silicone sealing ring can be removed for cleaning if necessary). Made of high-quality BPA-free plastic, Lock&Lock's Classic food-storage containers not only offer an airtight and watertight seal, but they're also durably built for unbreakable, long-lasting use and hygienic, food-safe storage. The containers can withstand temperatures ranging from -4 degrees F to 210 degrees F, making them suitable for use in the freezer, microwave* (reheating only), and dishwasher (top-rack). The base and lid should NOT be used in the oven, under browning elements, or on the stove top. Another thoughtful design detail includes the fact that the containers can be nested together, and with the lid in place, they can be stacked one on top of the other--particularly useful where space is limited. *Unlock all four latches and loosen lid before use in microwave. Detailed Features Patented Blocking Hole System    Consistent flow of resin--does not produce a weld line along the hinge. Inconsistent flow of resin--produces a weld line over time.   Lock&Lock Classic lids feature four side flaps or \"wings\" that are hinged and slightly flared at the end for an easy grip when opening. More importantly, they come with holes (rectangular-shaped openings) that line up with matching knobs on the base of the containers, making it easy to latch the lid to the base, locking it into place. This patented blocking hole system maintains the integrity of the lid and helps promote an easy, tightly locked container.  Lid's 4 wings come with holes that line up with base Weld line does not form around the hinge piece Hinge is designed to be short in length to prevent stiffness when opening and closing    Blue hollow-center silicon band in the lid helps create an airtight, leak-proof seal. Special Silicone In addition to its blocking hole system, the Classic food-storage containers feature a blue hollow-center silicon ring in the lid that helps create an airtight, leak-proof seal. Generic silicon with a solid center doesn't compress as well and doesn't have the same restorative power as hollow-center silicon, which means an inferior seal. Lock&Lock's hollow-center silicon seal delivers superior compression and restoration power that helps ensure an airtight seal. Permeability When testing the freshness of foods, one of the most important factors is the permeability of the container. In comparison to other brands, the permeability of Lock&Lock products showed to be drastically better.   Strawberries stored at room temperature for 5 days. The freshness test is determined throughout the world by how much moisture permeates various containers. Test results show Lock&Lock airtight containers allow in 3,000 - 6,000 times less moisture than other containers, making them far more airtight.   Airtight seal means no messy spills or leaks to worry about. Excellent Airtight Seal Lock&Lock airtight containers passed the leakage test. Their four-sided locking system makes an airtight seal possible due to equal pressure on all four sides and the hollow-center silicone sealing ring.   Passed the KEMTI bending test. Durable Design Lock&Lock airtight containers have also passed the KEMTI bending test. The container and the wing were fixed to the bending test machine and bent 3,000,000 times 80 degrees left to right. If the container were to be used 10 times a day, it could be used for 821 years (semi-permanently).   Hygienic and food-safe. Healthy Living Lock&Lock Classic food-storage containers have passed the strict hygiene and safety tests of the U.S. FDA and German SGS. Made of high-quality BPA-free plastic, the durable and heat-resistance containers are food-safe and health-friendly.   Nest and stack for space-saving storage. Space-Saving Design When not in use, the cleverly designed food-storage containers nest together, both lids and bases, for compact storage in a drawer or on a shelf. The containers also offer a stacking system for maximum space efficiency. The flat lids make it easy to stack one container on top of another--a slight edge helps to keep stacked items in securely place, whether in the freezer, refrigerator, or cupboard. Whether just one or building a collection of several, Lock&Lock's Classic airtight containers offer a smart solution for food storage.

This breadmaker will bake a whole 2-pound loaf of bread, and has menu courses for a variety of other cooking needs. Can you image the mouth-watering aroma of fresh baked bread in your home every day? Now you can choose the style that best matches your d\u00e9cor. From cinnamon-raisin bread for breakfast to buttery dinner rolls or garlic bread sticks to serve with dinner, this countertop appliance makes it easy to create delicious bakery-style artisan bread right at home. It can even be used to make homemade meatloaf, strawberry jam, chocolate cake, and more.  Easy to Use Choose from three crust shades -- light, medium, or dark -- and from 10 pre-programmed settings that consist of Basic, Basic Wheat, Basic Dough, Quick, Quick Wheat, Quick Dough, Jam, Cake, Sour Dough Starter, and Home Made. Best of all, the machine's timer can be set to delay the end of the baking cycle by up to 13 hours, which makes it possible to wake up to the smell of freshly baked, homemade bread in the morning or to come home to a warm loaf at the end of a long day at the office. The bread maker provides two blades for thorough dough kneading and a higher rise, a large viewing window, an \"on\" indicator light, a start/reset button, and a removable nonstick bread pan for easy cleaning. A double-ended teaspoon/tablespoon measuring spoon, an 8-ounce measuring cup, and a user manual with a variety of recipes come included.  Bake a Variety of Recipes It can even be used to make homemade meatloaf, strawberry jam, chocolate cake, and more. For a basic bread recipe, simply add in measured ingredients, close the lid, make a selection from the user-friendly LCD control panel, and the Home Bakery Supreme takes care of the rest--baking up a rectangular-shaped 2-pound loaf of bread to perfection.   Pre-programmed Baking Options Breads, cakes and other menu options are pre-programmed. In certain models, you can also program your own cycles as well. Whole Wheat  The extended kneading time helps knead heavier flour such as whole wheat and rye flour thoroughly. Jam Don't sweat over the stove stirring the pot; the Home Bakery will do it for you automatically. Enjoy preservatives and additive free jam all year round. Cake No need to get out the whisk or mixers; the Home Bakery will mix the ingredients AND automatically bake the cake for you. Home Made The Home Made cycle allows you to program the knead, rise and bake times to create your own menu setting. It even lets the Home Bakery work like an oven and bake meatloaf in it! Dough Prepares dough for you to shape and bake in the oven. Enjoy fun recipes such as pizza, bagels, pretzels and cinnamon rolls.  Simplify Making Homemade Bread Use Fresh Ingredients First, prepare fresh ingredients. Quality of the finished bread will depend on ingredients used. Avoid mixing in old or stale ingredients.  Attach Blades Blades are especially important parts of the breadmakers. Make sure the blades are properly attached. Measure Ingredients Next, measure ingredients accurately. The more accurate the measurements are, the better the finished bread will be. Rough measurements will result in a rough bread.   Add Ingredients in Order Ingredients have lives. There are compatibilities among ingredients, too. Through trials and errors, we found a right order for adding ingredients. Please add in the order of liquids, powders, and yeast to be assured your bread comes out the way you want.  Select Course Finally, make sure to choose the right course setting.

Allow the unit to cool down for least 30 minutes before handling. Use the cleaning/scraping tool to remove any leftover food from the cooking plate. The scraping tool can be washed by hand or in the dishwasher. Dispose of grease from the drip tray once cooled. The drip tray can be cleaned by hand or in the dishwasher. Press the plate release buttons to remove plates from the housing. Be sure that the plates have cooled completely before handling (at least 30 minutes). The cooking plates can be washed in the dishwasher. The housing base, cover and control knobs can be wiped clean with a soft, dry cloth. For tough stains, dampen cloth.  The Griddler's Many Uses       Contact Grill Use the Griddler as a contact grill to cook burgers, boneless pieces of meat and thin cuts of meat and vegetables. The contact grill function works best when you want to cook something in a short amount of time or when you are looking for a healthy method of grilling. When cooked on the contact grill, food will cook quickly because you are grilling both sides of the food at the same time. The ribs on the grill side of the plates, combined with the grease spout at the rear of the plate, allow the grease to drip from the meat and drain off the plates. When the Griddler is used as a contact grill, the grill side of plates is recommended. Rest the cover evenly on top of the food until it has reached the desired cooked temperature. The Griddler was designed with a unique handle and hinge that allow the cover to adjust to the thickness of the food. You can easily grill anything from a thinly sliced potato to a thick sirloin steak with even results. When cooking more than one food item in the contact grill, it is important that the thickness of food items is consistent so the cover will close evenly on the food.   Panini Press Use the Griddler as a panini press to grill sandwiches, breads and quesadillas. The sandwich is pressed between two grill or griddle plates to toast the bread and warm the sandwich. We recommend using fresh-baked bread to produce the best tasting panini. When the Griddler is used as a panini press, the grill side of the plates is recommended. We recommend the grill side of the plates because traditional style panini sandwiches have grill marks on the bread. However, depending upon the type of sandwich you are preparing, you may wish to use the griddle side of the plates or any combination of the two. The Griddler functions as a panini press in the same manner that it functions as a contact grill. The Griddler was designed with a unique handle and hinge that allow the cover to adjust to the thickness of the sandwich you are preparing and to rest there evenly. Light pressure can be applied to the handle to press and heat the sandwich to your liking.     Full Grill Use the Griddler as a full grill to cook burgers, steak, poultry (we do not recommend cooking bone-in chicken, since it does not cook evenly on a full grill), fish and vegetables. Full grill refers to using the Griddler with the cover lying flat, creating a double, flat cooking surface. In this position, the foods you are grilling will have to be turned over for cooking. When the Griddler is used as a full grill, the grill side of the plates should be used. Cooking on the full grill is the most versatile method of using the Griddler. With the full grill, you have double the surface area (200 square Inch) for grilling. You have the option of cooking different types of foods on separate plates without combining their flavors, or cooking large amounts of the same type of food. The full grill also accommodates different cuts of meats with varying thickness, allowing you to cook each piece to your liking.     Full Griddle Use the Griddle as a full griddle to cook pancakes, eggs, French toast, hash browns and breakfast meats. When you use the Griddler as a full griddle, open the cover so it lies flat, creating a double, flat cooking surface. In this position, the foods you are preparing will have to be turned over for cooking. When using this cooking function, the griddle side of the plates should be used. Cooking on the full griddle is a wonderful way to prepare breakfast for two or for a large family. The large surface area allows you to cook a variety of different foods at the same time, or large amounts of your favorite food.   Half Grill/Half Griddle Use the Griddler as a half grill/half griddle in order to create full meals like bacon and eggs or steak and potatoes at the same time. When using the Griddler as a half grill/half griddle, simply place the unit in the flat position and insert one plate with the grill side facing up and another plate with the griddle side facing up. This cooking option allows you to use either the grill/panini temperature or the griddle temperature selector.   To Insert Cooking Plates Adjust the Griddler to the flat position with the controls directly in front of you. Insert one plate at a time. Each plate is designed to fit in either the upper housing or the lower housing of the Griddler. If you are facing the Griddler, the drip spout should be at the rear of the plate. Locate the metal brackets at the center of the housing. Tilt the back end of the plate and line up the cutouts at the back of the plate with metal brackets. Slide the plate underneath the brackets and push down the front end of the plate. It will snap into place. Turn the Griddler around and insert the second plate on either its grill or griddle side into the upper housing as you did with the first plate.

Specialty items, like the Griddler, offer today\u2019s consumers a variety of menu options and fun and easy new ways to entertain family and friends.

Sanyo's electrolyzed water technology has been tested and proven effective in suppressing airborne germs, bacteria, odors, allergens and mold through third party certification institutions including RTI. In addition, electrolyzed water has proven effective in significantly reducing the level of viable airborne germs and bacteria, according to an independent research institution in the United States. Simply add tap water to the water container and the chlorine ions in the tap water are molecularly split through an electrolysis process in the unit into electrolyzed water. The electrolyzed water attacks the protein spikes in bacteria and inactivates the spikes so they are unable to attach to human cells.
